AB  - Combined interventions for neuromodulation leading to neurorecovery have gained great attention by researchers to resemble clinical rehabilitation approaches. In this randomized clinical trial, we established changes in the net output of motoneurons innervating multiple leg muscles during stepping when transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex was paired with transcutaneous spinal (transspinal) stimulation over the thoracolumbar region during locomotor training. TMS was delivered before (TMS-transspinal) or after (transspinal-TMS) transspinal stimulation during the stance phase of the less impaired leg. Ten individuals with chronic incomplete or complete SCI received at least 20 sessions of training. Each session consisted of 240 paired stimuli delivered over 10-min blocks for 1 h during robotic assisted step training on a motorized treadmill. Body weight support, leg guidance force and treadmill speed were adjusted based on each subject's ability to step without knee buckling or toe dragging. Most transspinal evoked potentials (TEPs) recorded before and after each intervention from ankle and knee muscles during assisted stepping were modulated in a phase-dependent pattern. Transspinal-TMS and locomotor training affected motor neuron output of knee and ankle muscles with ankle TEPs to be modulated in a phase-dependent manner. TMS-transspinal and locomotor training increased motor neuron output for knee but not for ankle muscles. Our results support that targeted brain and spinal cord stimulation alters responsiveness of neurons over multiple spinal segments in people with chronic SCI. Noninvasive stimulation of the brain and spinal cord along with locomotor training is a novel neuromodulation method that can become a promising modality for rehabilitation in humans after SCI.

AB  - Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide despite recent advances in hyperacute interventions to lessen the initial impact of stroke. Stroke recovery therapies are crucial in reducing the long-term disability burden after stroke. Stroke recovery treatment options have rapidly expanded within the last decade, and we are in the dawn of an exciting era of multimodal therapeutic approaches to improve post-stroke recovery. In this narrative review, we highlighted various promising advances in treatment and technologies targeting stroke rehabilitation, including activity-based therapies, non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques, robotics-assisted therapies, brain–computer interfaces, pharmacological treatments, and cognitive therapies. These new therapies are targeted to enhance neural plasticity as well as provide an adequate dose of rehabilitation and improve adherence and participation. Novel activity-based therapies and telerehabilitation are promising tools to improve accessibility and provide adequate dosing. Multidisciplinary treatment models are crucial for post-stroke neurorehabilitation, and further adjuvant treatments with brain stimulation techniques and pharmacological agents should be considered to maximize the recovery. Among many challenges in the field, the heterogeneity of patients included in the study and the mixed methodologies and results across small-scale studies are the cardinal ones. Biomarker-driven individualized approaches will move the field forward, and so will large-scale clinical trials with a well-targeted patient population. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - 4D printing of smart materials is a viable field of research for fabricating dynamic structures for various biomedical applications. 4D printing of hydrogel structures is challenging due to poor printability of hydrogels and poor shape fidelity of printed patterns when direct-ink writing-based 3D printers are used. In this study, chitosan (CS) hydrogel ink cross-linked with citric acid (CA) was made printable, exhibiting a shape-morphing behaviour when exposed to solvent as an external trigger. As one side of a printed structure is exposed to solvent, the solvent diffuses in and a concentration gradient is developed across the section. This concentration gradient results in displacement field, which finally leads to out-of-plane bending of the structure. This actuation is irreversible in nature since the concentration gradient is maintained between hydrophilic chitosan and hydrophobic silane layers. The reversibility of the morphed structures was achieved by dipping them in ethanol, which takes up solvent over time and thus diminishes the concentration gradient.The optimized CS/CA ink exhibited excellent rheological properties, with good extrudability and shape fidelity of printed structures. The chitosan ink was printed into various complex 3D architectures and was modified by hydrophobic coating of trimethyl silane (TMS). These hydrophobic patterns were coated on printed structures with varied interspacing, angles, and hinges to generate programmable designs. A printed soft gripper was demonstrated as an application that could lift an object seven times its weight. The shape morphing CS/CA hydrogel with excellent printability exhibits potential for 4D printing that has wide applications in soft robots, actuators, grippers, and sensors. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

AB  - Background: Over the past decade, many studies in the field of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in stroke have been published in scholarly journals. However, a scientometric analysis focusing on tDCS after stroke is still missing. The purpose of this study is to deliver a bibliometric analysis to investigate the global hotspots and frontiers in the domain of tDCS in stroke from 2012 to 2021. Methods: Articles and reviews related to tDCS in stroke were retrieved and obtained from the Web of Science core collection database from 2012 to 2021. Data visualization and analysis were conducted by using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Microsoft Excel 2019. Results: Finally, 371 publications were included in the scientometric analysis, including 288 articles and 83 reviews. The results showed that the number of publications per year increased from 15 to 68 in the last 10 years. Neurosciences was the main research hotspot category (n = 201). Frontiers in Human Neuroscience was the most published journal with 14 papers. The most productive author, institution, and country were Fregni F (n = 13), the League of European Research Universities (n = 37), and the United States of America (n = 98), respectively. A burstness analysis of keywords and the literature indicated that current studies in the field of tDCS in stroke focused on poststroke aphasia, tDCS combined with robotic therapy, and anatomical parameters. Conclusion: The research of tDCS in stroke is predicted to remain a research hotspot in the future. We recommend investigating the curative effect of other different tDCS closed-loop rehabilitation methods for different stroke dysfunctions. In conclusion, this bibliometric study presented the hotspots and trends of tDCS in stroke over the last decade, which may help researchers manage their further studies. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - There has been an increasing demand for robotic coil positioning during repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment. Accurate coil positioning is crucial because rTMS generally targets specific brain regions for both research and clinical application with other reasons such as safety, consistency and reliability and individual variablity. Some previous studies have employed industrial robots or co-robots and showed they can more precisely stimulate the target cortical regions than traditional manual methods. In this study, we not only developed a custom-TMS robot for better TMS coil placement but also analyzed the therapeutic effects on depression. Treatment effects were evaluated by measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using single-photon emission computed tomography and depression severity before and after rTMS for the two positioning methods. The rTMS preparation time with our robotic coil placement was reduced by 53% compared with that of the manual method. The position and orientation errors were also significantly reduced from 11.17 mm and 4.06° to 0.94 mm and 0.11°, respectively, confirming the superiority of robotic positioning. The results from clinical and neuroimaging assessments indicated comparable improvements in depression severity and rCBF in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the robotic and manual rTMS groups. A questionnaire was used to determine the patients’ feelings about the robotic system, including the safety and preparation time. A high safety score indicated good acceptability of robotic rTMS at the clinical site. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Brain stimulation using noninvasive methods has been widely adopted in neuropsychiatric disorder therapies. Clinicians who use the innovative methods situate the stimulator manually in a typical setup. However, this causes practical difficulties in precisely locating the stimulation device at a desired pose. This article proposes a robotic positioning system that can precisely position a brain stimulation device at the desired pose. The design concepts are focused on the development of a system with a workspace specialized in noninvasive brain stimulation. To stimulate the overall area around the upper part of the head, the system is designed to have a specific posture with a six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) movable parallel mechanism and a 1-DOF extra revolute joint. The combined system not only significantly increases the workspace of the system but also increases its physical safety. In the movable parallel mechanism, we realize sufficient mobility for the robotic device using three-P RPS chains (P: curved prismatic joint, R: revolute joint, P: prismatic joint, and S: spherical joint). The curved prismatic joint (P) is a revolute joint realized by curved rail and enables efficient movement of the stimulator around the subject's head. Furthermore, the parallel mechanism offers good physical safety and load-carrying capacity. The moving platform, which is close to the head, exhibits low inertia, and there is no rapid change in the acceleration due to the failure of control because the moving platform is moved as a combination of joint movements. The system can accommodate stimulators of varying weights, such as those employing transcranial magnetic stimulation and ultrasound transducers. A prototype of the proposed system was developed using the design specifications, and its performance was verified experimentally.  © 1996-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Context: Motor deficits are among the most common consequences of incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). These impairments can affect patients’ levels of functioning and quality of life. Combined robotic therapy and non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) have been used to improve motor impairments in patients with corticospinal tract lesions. Objectives: To examine the effects of combined robotic therapy and NIBS on motor function post incomplete SCI. Methods: PubMed, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, PEDro, Web of Science, REHABDATA, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched from inception until July 2023. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale was employed to evaluate the selected studies quality. Results: Of 557 studies, five randomized trials (n = 122), with 25% of participants being females, were included in this review. The PEDro scores ranged from eight to nine, with a median score of nine. There were variations in treatment protocols and outcome measures, resulting in heterogeneous findings. The findings showed revealed evidence for the impacts of combined robotic therapy and NIBS on motor function in individuals with incomplete SCI. Conclusions: Combined robotic training and NIBS may be safe for individuals with incomplete SCI. The existing evidence concerning its effects on motor outcomes in individuals with SCI is limited. Further experimental studies are needed to understand the effects of combined robotic training and NIBS on motor impairments in SCI populations. © The Academy of Spinal Cord Injury Professionals, Inc. 2024.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis is a slowly progressive disease, immunosuppressants and other drugs can delay the progression and progression of the disease, but the most patients will be left with varying degrees of neurological deficit symptoms, such as muscle weakness, muscle spasm, ataxia, sensory impairment, dysphagia, cognitive dysfunction, psychological disorders, etc. From the early stage of the disease to the stage of disease progression, professional rehabilitation treatment can reduce the functional dysfunction of multiple sclerosis patients, improve neurological function, and reduce family and social burdens. With the development of various new rehabilitation technologies such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, virtual reality technology, robot-assisted gait, telerehabilitation and transcranial direct current stimulation, the advantages of rehabilitation therapy in multiple sclerosis treatment have been further established, and more treatment means have also been provided for patients.

AB  - Background: Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a group of inheritance diseases resulting in gait abnormalities, which may be detected using instrumented gait analysis. The aim of this systematic review was 2-fold: to identify specific gait analysis patterns and interventions improving gait in HSP subjects. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, REHABDATA, and PEDro databases, in accordance with reporting guidelines of PRISMA statement and Cochrane's recommendation. The review protocol was recorded on the PROSPERO register. Patients with pure and complicated HSP of any age were included. All types of studies were included. Risk of bias, quality assessment, and meta-analysis were performed. Results: Forty-two studies were included: 19 were related to gait analysis patterns, and 24 were intervention studies. The latter ones were limited to adults. HSP gait patterns were similar to cerebral palsy in younger subjects and stroke in adults. Knee hyperextension, reduced range of motion at knee, ankle, and hip, reduced foot lift, and increased rapid trunk and arm movements were reported. Botulinum injections reduced spasticity but uncovered weakness and improved gait velocity at follow-up. Weak evidence supported intrathecal baclofen, active intensive physical therapy (i.e., robot-assisted gait training, functional exercises, and hydrotherapy), and functional electrical stimulation. Some improvements but adverse events were reported after transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation, and spinal cord stimulation implant. Conclusion: Knee hyperextension, non-sagittal pelvic movements, and reduced ROM at the knee, ankle, and hip represent the most peculiar patterns in HSP, compared to diplegic cerebral palsy and stroke. Botulinum improved comfortable gait velocity after 2 months. Nonetheless, interventions reducing spasticity might result in ineffective functional outcomes unveiling weakness. Intensive active physical therapy and FES might improve gait velocity in the very short term. Copyright © 2023 Faccioli, Cavalagli, Falocci, Mangano, Sanfilippo and Sassi.

AB  - This study demonstrated that upper limb robotic therapy (ULRT) combined with 1 Hz low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (LF-rTMS) improved upper limb (UL) function and activities of daily living (ADLs) in stroke patients. 16 stroke patients were treated with 1 Hz LF-rTMS on non-affected cerebral hemisphere, 8 in ULRT group, and 8 in the UL combined with traditional occupational therapy (ULTOT) group. Assessment include fugl-meyer assessment (FMA), modified ashworth scale (MAS), and modified bar-thel index (MBI). As a result, ULRT group showed significant differences in FMA, MAS, and MBI (p<0.05), and ULTOT group showed significant differences in FMA and MBI in two groups (p<0.05). There were significant differences in FMA, MAS, and MBI between two groups (p<0.05) (p<0.001). Through this, ULTOT group and ULRT group with 1 Hz LF-rTMS helped UL function and ADLs. In particular, ULRT with 1 Hz LF-rTMS helped improve UL function and ADLs. © The Korean Magnetics Society.

AB  - This article focuses on the development of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) by utilizing advanced 2D nanomaterials with innovative design and easy fabrication method to achieve durable TENG with high-power density and improved cycling performance. Herein, we fabricated a layer-by-layer stacked vertical contact-separation (CS) mode TENG. In this unique design, we incorporated a thin film of micron-sized Ti3C2Tx-MXene ultrathin sheets (TMSs) into a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) based tribo-negative electrode. A tribo-positive layer was prepared by integrating an optimized amount of NaCl into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix. After optimization of both triboelectric layers, the optimized TMS-TENG showed an open-circuit voltage (Voc) ∼ 390 V, short-circuit current (Isc) ∼ 96 μA, and power density of 6.66 W·m−2. The boosted performance is due to the synergistic effect of TMSs, used as a charge trapping layer on the electronegative side, and the impact of an NaCl:PVA impregnated layer on the electropositive side of the TENG. The ultrathin-layered structures of sandwiched TMS film serve bifunctionally as a charge accumulation and charge trapping entity simultaneously, increasing the charge separation due to high dielectric constant, and thus increasing the overall output power of the fabricated TENG. The prepared TMS-TENG was tested as a pressure sensor to monitor different sensitive physiological movements of the human body. Further applications of the designed TMS-TENGs have been revealed by powering more than 500 LEDs, an electronic calulator, and swiftly charging micro-capacitors by utilizing direct output power. By engineering electrodes, we can gain insight into the specific role that TMSs play in enhancing the performance of TENGs. This research provides a new avenue for designing self-powered pressure/motion sensors in robotics and harvesting biomechanical energy as electrical energy for sustainable electronics. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Background: Stroke is a leading cause of lifelong disability worldwide, partially driven by a reduced ability to use the upper limb in daily life causing increased dependence on caregivers. However, post-stroke functional impairments have only been investigated using limited clinical scores, during short-term longitudinal studies in relatively small patient cohorts. With the addition of technology-based assessments, we propose to complement clinical assessments with more sensitive and objective measures that could more holistically inform on upper limb impairment recovery after stroke, its impact on upper limb use in daily life, and on overall quality of life. This paper describes a pragmatic, longitudinal, observational study protocol aiming to gather a uniquely rich multimodal database to comprehensively describe the time course of upper limb recovery in a representative cohort of 400 Asian adults after stroke. Particularly, we will characterize the longitudinal relationship between upper limb recovery, common post-stroke impairments, functional independence and quality of life. Methods: Participants with stroke will be tested at up to eight time points, from within a month to 3 years post-stroke, to capture the influence of transitioning from hospital to community settings. We will perform a battery of established clinical assessments to describe the factors most likely to influence upper limb recovery. Further, we will gather digital health biomarkers from robotic or wearable sensing technology-assisted assessments to sensitively characterize motor and somatosensory impairments and upper limb use in daily life. We will also use both quantitative and qualitative measures to understand health-related quality of life. Lastly, we will describe neurophysiological motor status using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Statistics: Descriptive analyses will be first performed to understand post-stroke upper limb impairments and recovery at various time points. The relationships between digital biomarkers and various domains will be explored to inform key aspects of upper limb recovery and its dynamics using correlation matrices. Multiple statistical models will be constructed to characterize the time course of upper limb recovery post-stroke. Subgroups of stroke survivors exhibiting distinct recovery profiles will be identified. Conclusion: This is the first study complementing clinical assessments with technology-assisted digital biomarkers to investigate upper limb sensorimotor recovery in Asian stroke survivors. Overall, this study will yield a multimodal data set that longitudinally characterizes post-stroke upper limb recovery in functional impairments, daily-life upper limb use, and health-related quality of life in a large cohort of Asian stroke survivors. This data set generates valuable information on post-stroke upper limb recovery and potentially allows researchers to identify different recovery profiles of subgroups of Asian stroke survivors. This enables the comparisons between the characteristics and recovery profiles of stroke survivors in different regions. Thus, this study lays out the basis to identify early predictors for upper limb recovery, inform clinical decision-making in Asian stroke survivors and establish tailored therapy programs.

AB  - The application of orthoses for neurorehabilitation has experienced tremendous development in the past years, evolving from simple ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) and knee-ankle-foot orthoses (KAFOs) to a brain-computer interface coupled with robotic limbs. Several national societies for the treatment of strokes and other neurological diseases recommend the application of classical orthotic devices (AFO, KAFO, and hip-knee-ankle-foot orthosis). Emerging technologies have also influenced orthoses. In the group of the modern orthoses, the upper and lower robotic exoskeletons, biosignal-based interfaces for robotic tool control (EMG-based and EEG-based interfaces), have limited clinical usage due to their respective costs. Moreover, some exoskeletons (lower limbs) are too large; therefore, these exoskeletons must be installed in neurorehabilitation facilities. Apart from orthoses, neurostimulation and neuromodulation can also be used to induce recovery in sensory or motor functions, induce reduction in joint stiffness, and improve memory dysfunctions. Neurostimulation is a branch of neuromodulation that employs electromagnetic currents. Neurostimulation is divided into noninvasive and invasive stimulation. Microelectrodes (invasive stimulation) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (non-invasive stimulation), are used to modulate nervous system responses. Neurostimulation is essential to the development of neural, hearing, artificial vision, and limbs prosthetics. Transcranial magnetic stimulation has been widely used to improve the level of paralysis in stroke patients. Orthosis, in contrast, uses the patient’s capabilities, extends their range of motion, and improves the precision of motion and quality of life. Both orthoses and neurostimulation help with the complex management of patients undergoing neurorehabilitation. Only a team of experienced physicians can manage the diversity and complexity of patients requiring neurorehabilitation. © 2022 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Our first goal is to understand the research status and popularity of telerehabilitation research for stroke survivors since 2012; the second goal is to analyze the research trends and frontiers in this field, and provide a scientific basis for the future application of telerehabilitation technology in patients with poststroke functional defects. We searched the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) for literature on telerehabilitation for stroke survivors published from 2012 to 2022. The included articles were visually analyzed using CiteSpace6.1.6R (64-bit). In total, 968 eligible articles were included in this study. In the past 10 years, the number of papers published on telerehabilitation after stroke has been increasing annually, with the largest number of papers published in the United States and Australia, with 101 papers published by Chinese scholars. Some subsets of cooperative networks have been formed among major research institutions and their authors, but the scale remains small, and academic exchanges and cooperation need to be strengthened further. Research on virtual reality (VR) technology and rehabilitation robot technology is popular, and the choice of time and intensity of rehabilitation exercises, patients' participation in rehabilitation exercises, and care are also worth attention. In the last 10 years, research on telerehabilitation technology in the field of rehabilitation for stroke survivors has steadily developed, and is characterized by multidisciplinary joint development. Countries around the world can combine their own characteristics and advantages, strengthen academic exchanges and cooperation with mature research institutions or authors, and explore suitable poststroke remote rehabilitation technologies and service models in different environments. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Independent control of movements between the fingers plays a role in hand dexterity characterizing skilled individuals. However, it remains unknown whether and in what manner neuromuscular and biomechanical constraints on the movement independence of the fingers depend on motor expertise. Here, we compared motor dexterity, corticospinal excitability of multiple muscles, muscular activation, and anatomical features of the fingers between the pianists and nonpianists. When the ring finger was passively moved by a robot, passive motions produced at the adjacent fingers were smaller for the pianists than the nonpianists, indicating reduced biomechanical constraint of fingers in the pianists. In contrast, when the ring finger moved actively, we found no group difference in passive motions produced at the adjacent fingers; however, reduced inhibition of corticospinal excitability of the adjacent fingers in the pianists compared with the nonpianists. This suggests strengthened neuromuscular coupling between the fingers of the pianists, enhancing the production of coordinated finger movements. These group differences were not evident during the index and little finger movements. Together, pianists show expertise-dependent biomechanical and neurophysiological adaptations, specifically at the finger with innately low movement independence. Such contrasting adaptations of pianists may subserve dexterous control of both the individuated and coordinated finger movements.  © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect and mechanism of robot-assisted upper limb training (RT) combined with intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) for stroke patients are unclear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in brain activation after combination therapy and RT alone using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to two groups (iTBS + RT Group, n = 18, and RT Group, n = 18). Training was conducted five times a week for four weeks. fNIRS was used to measure changes in oxyhemoglobin in both the primary motor cortex (M1) and pre-motor and supplementary motor area (pSMA) during affected limb movement. Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) was employed for evaluating the function of upper limbs. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with subacute stroke completed the study. The cortex of both hemispheres was extensively activated prior to treatment in the RT group. After training, overactivation decreased. The brain activation of the combined treatment group transferred to the affected side after the treatment. There was a notable enhancement in the FMA-UE scores for both groups, with the combined group's progress significantly surpassing that of the RT group. CONCLUSION: RT combined with iTBS can improve the motor function of stroke patients and promote the balance between cerebral hemispheres.  © 2024 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hybrid meetings are the standard solution to balance remote and on-site work. They are built around on-site participants, and online and on-demand (offline) participants are at risk of being ignored. This paper set out to determine how hybrid meetings could be more engaging and interactive. As a solution, the Tribrid-Meeting-Setup (TMS) is presented. The TMS allows online participants to have an active role during the meeting by using a Telepresence-Robot (TPR) and give an interactive perspective of the meeting to the on-demand (offline) participants by recording the meeting in a 360° video format. An iterative prototype development approach was implemented for designing the TMS. This article summarizes how to build a TMS, the results of the first test using the TMS, and further recommendations for the TMS. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Mechanical stimulation-conditioned transcranial magnetic stimulation (Mstim-cTMS) is a neuromodulation technique that transiently enhances neural excitability through paired peripheral and cortical stimulation. Importantly, the temporal inter-stimulus interval (ISI) must fall within an individual's specific ISI window (ISI-W) to induce neuromodulatory effects. Currently, ISI-W identification is inefficient, incrementally applying Mstim-cTMS within a wide search range. This paper aims to test a real-time, closed-loop framework that decreases the number of trials required to obtain individualized ISI-Ws by implementing a previously developed statistical regression algorithm. Each Mstim-cTMS trial consisted of peripheral mechanical stimulation using a precise, tapping robot paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation to the motor cortex. Neuromodulation was characterized by measuring resulting motor evoked potentials (MEPs). The closed-loop process estimated the effective ISI-W by iterating Mstim-cTMS at statistically determined ISIs based on the detected MEPs. The estimated ISI-Ws of two subjects had an average correlation coefficient of 0.84 with their reference windows obtained using the conventional search method. The estimation reduced the number of required Mstim-cTMS trials by an average of 93.8%. The results indicate the proposed method's potential for decreasing Mstim-cTMS startup durations. Future rehabilitation and neurophysiological studies can benefit from efficiently updating ISI-Ws to account for long-term neural variability.  © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - This work proposes a safety-critical local reactive controller that enables the robot to navigate in unknown and cluttered environments. In particular, the trajectory tracking task is formulated as a constrained polynomial optimization problem. Then, safety constraints are imposed on the control variables invoking the notion of polynomial positivity certificates in conjunction with their Sum-of-Squares (SOS) approximation, thereby confining the robot motion inside the locally extracted convex free region. It is noteworthy that, in the process of devising the proposed safety constraints, the geometry of the robot can be approximated using any shape that can be characterized with a set of polynomial functions. The optimization problem is further convexified into a semidefinite program (SDP) leveraging truncated multi-sequences (TMS) and moment relaxation, which favorably facilitates the effective use of off-the-shelf conic programming solvers, such that real-time performance is attainable. Various robot navigation tasks are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of safety and tracking performance.  © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review and examine the current literature regarding the effects of virtual reality (VR)–based rehabilitation on neural plasticity changes in survivors of stroke. Data Sources: We searched 6 bioscience and engineering databases, including Medline via EBSCO, Embase, PsycINFO, IEEE Explore, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health, and Scopus. Study Selection: We selected studies reporting on the pre-post assessment of a VR intervention with neural plasticity measures published between 2000 and 2021. Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers conducted study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. They assessed methodological quality of controlled trials using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale and evaluated risk of bias of pre-post intervention and case studies using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool. Data Synthesis: We included 27 studies (n=232). We rated 7 randomized-controlled trials as good quality and 2 clinical-controlled trials as moderate. Based on the risk of bias assessment, we graded 1 pre-post study and 1 case study as good quality, 1 pre-post study and 1 case study as poor, and the other 14 studies as fair. After the VR intervention, main neurophysiological findings across studies include: (1) improved interhemispheric balance; (2) enhanced cortical connectivity; (3) increased cortical mapping of the affected limb muscles; (4) the improved neural plasticity measures were correlated to the enhanced behavior outcomes; (5) increased activation of regions in frontal cortex; and (6) the mirror neuron system may be involved. Conclusions: VR-induced changes in neural plasticity for survivors of stroke. Positive correlations between the neural plasticity changes and functional recovery elucidates the mechanisms of VR-based therapeutic effects in stroke rehabilitation. This review prompts systematic understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms of VR-based stroke rehabilitation and summarizes the emerging evidence for ongoing innovation of VR systems and application in stroke rehabilitation. © 2021 The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine

AB  - In this study, an optimal time-safety collision trajectory planning method of manipulator is proposed. It optimizes the coupling and contradictory performance indexes of manipulator joint motion time and safety collision coefficient. The trajectory of the manipulator can be transformed into the position and time series in the joint space by Inverse Kinematics (IK). Among the splines, quintic B-spline used commonly for interpolating robotic trajectories is preferred also in this study. Under the constraints of the manipulator, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms-II (NSGA-II) is used to optimize the objective function. The total optimized running time is shortened by 33.07 s. The main joints damage before and after optimization of safety collision have been reduced more than 49.4%. After quintic B-spline interpolation, the time-safety collision of manipulator trajectory are effectively optimized. In general, the execution efficiency of the manipulator is improved, the collision damage to the human head is reduced, and the motion control performance of TMS manipulator is improved to be widely used in medical clinic. © 2022

AB  - Pediatric stroke is a condition that often results in life-long motor, cognitive, or sensory deficits for children. The purpose of this focused review is to compile the most recent literature on pediatric stroke neuromotor interventions and summarize evidence for use by rehabilitation providers and researchers. Terms including stroke, pediatric, and neuromotor were searched with appropriate MeSH terms. Information was collected regarding interventions conducted and outcome measures used for each article. Interventions and outcome measures were organized based on ICF components (Body Structure and Function, Activity, Participation, and Environmental Factors). 16 articles were included after full-text screens. From these 16 articles, a large majority of them included some form of neuromodulation as a part of intervention. Results identified a potentially problematic gap between domains addressed by interventions and measured by outcomes, with a need to include more expansive outcome measures in research studies. There are several areas of potential growth in pediatric stroke literature. Research studies should be precise when describing included samples. As interventions for pediatric stroke shift toward neuromodulation and other neurologic treatments, there is a need for well-defined populations, both clinically in the community as well as in research studies. There is also a need for US guidelines for rehabilitation after pediatric stroke. Overall, the trend in the literature seems to suggest that combining some form of neuromodulatory technique with existing recommended rehabilitation technique (ex: CIMT) may promote overall recovery for children after stroke, though further research is needed. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Stanford neuromodulation therapy (SNT) is the state-of-the-art magnetic stimulation protocol that has been developed for management of treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The study was aimed to assess the possibility of SNT implementation in clinical practice and to define the protocol safety and efficacy in patients with TRD being an episode of the recurrent depressive disorder or bipolar disorder at the independent center. The study involved six patients (among them three women aged 21-66) with TRD associated with recurrent depression and type 1 or 2 bipolar disorder. The patients received intermittent theta-burst stimulation in accordance with the SNT protocol for five days: applying 10 triple blocks of stimulation daily at intervals of 1 hr between the blocks to the selected stimulation site showing maximum negative functional connectivity with subgenual cingulate cortex within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used for clinical assessment of the effects, the follow-up period was three months. The improvement of depressive symptoms to the levels characteristic of remission immediately after the SNT completion was observed in five patients (MADRS score ≤10). After three months, two patients still had remission, the condition of three patients met the criteria of mild depressive episode, and one female patient withdrew from the study due to logistical difficulties. No serious adverse events were reported. The findings confirm safety and potentially high efficacy of SNT, including in patients with type 1 and 2 bipolar disorders. © 2022 Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel jump control method based on Two Mass Spring Damp Inverted Pendulum (TMS-DIP) model, which makes the third generation of hydraulic driven wheel-legged robot prototype (WLR-3P) achieve stable jumping. Design/methodology/approach: First, according to the configuration of the WLR, a TMS-DIP model is proposed to simplify the dynamic model of the robot. Then the jumping process is divided into four stages: thrust, ascent, descent and compression, and each stage is modeled and solved independently based on TMS-DIP model. Through WLR-3P kinematics, the trajectory of the upper and lower centroids of the TMS-DIP model can be mapped to the joint space of the robot. The corresponding control strategies are proposed for jumping height, landing buffer, jumping attitude and robotic balance, so as to realize the stable jump control of the WLR. Findings: The TMS-DIP model proposed in this paper can simplify the WLR dynamic model and provide a simple and effective tool for the jumping trajectory planning of the robot. The proposed approach is suitable for hydraulic WLR jumping control. The performance of the proposed wheel-legged jump method was verified by experiments on WLR-3P. Originality/value: This work provides an effective model (TMS-DIP) for the jump control of WLR-3P. The results showed that the number of landing shock (twice) and the pitch angle fluctuation range (0.44 rad) of center of mass of the jump control method based on TMS-DIP model are smaller than those based on spring-loaded inverted pendulum model. Therefore, the TMS-DIP model makes the jumping process of WLR more stable and gentler. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effect of robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) therapy combined with non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) on lower limb function in patients with stroke and spinal cord injury (SCI). Data sources: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science were searched. Study selection: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published as of 3 March 2021. RCTs evaluating RAGT combined with NIBS, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), for lower limb function (e.g., Fugl-Meyer assessment for patients with stroke) and activities (i.e., gait velocity) in patients with stroke and SCI were included. Data extraction: Two reviewers independently screened the records, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias. Data synthesis: A meta-analysis of five studies (104 participants) and risk of bias were conducted. Pooled estimates demonstrated that RAGT combined with NIBS significantly improved lower limb function [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.06–0.99] but not lower limb activities (SMD = −0.13; 95% CI = −0.63–0.38). Subgroup analyses also failed to find a greater improvement in lower limb function of RAGT with tDCS compared to sham stimulation. No significant differences between participant characteristics or types of NIBS were observed. Conclusion: This meta-analysis demonstrated that RAGT therapy in combination with NIBS was effective in patients with stroke and SCI. However, a greater improvement in lower limb function and activities were not observed using RAGT with tDCS compared to sham stimulation.

AB  - Background: Repetitive task practice reduces mean upper extremity motor impairment in populations of patients with chronic stroke, but individual response is highly variable. A method to predict meaningful reduction in impairment in response to training based on biomarkers and other data collected prior to an intervention is needed to establish realistic rehabilitation goals and to effectively allocate resources. Objectives: To identify prognostic factors and better understand the biological substrate for reductions in arm impairment in response to repetitive task practice among patients with chronic (≥6 months) post-stroke hemiparesis. Methods: The intervention is a form of repetitive task practice using a combination of robot-assisted therapy and functional arm use in real-world tasks. Baseline measures include the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Wolf Motor Function Test, Action Research Arm Test, Stroke Impact Scale, questionnaires on pain and expectancy, MRI, transcranial magnetic stimulation, kinematics, accelerometry, and genomic testing. Results: Mean increase in FM-UE was 4.6 ± 1.0 SE, median 2.5. Approximately one-third of participants had a clinically meaningful response to the intervention, defined as an increase in FM ≥ 5. The selected logistic regression model had a receiver operating curve with AUC =.988 (Std Error =.011, 95% Wald confidence limits:.967–1) showed little evidence of overfitting. Six variables that predicted response represented impairment, functional, and genomic measures. Conclusion: A simple weighted sum of 6 baseline factors can accurately predict clinically meaningful impairment reduction after outpatient intensive practice intervention in chronic stroke. Reduction of impairment may be a critical first step to functional improvement. Further validation and generalization of this model will increase its utility in clinical decision-making. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Objective: Functional resistance training (FRT) during walking is an emerging approach for rehabilitating individuals with neuromuscular or orthopedic injuries. During FRT, wearable exoskeleton/braces can target resistance to a weakened leg joint; however, the resistive properties of the training depend on the type of resistive elements used in the device. Hence, this study was designed to examine how the biomechanical and neural effects of functional resistance training differ with viscous and elastic resistances during both treadmill and overground walking. Methods: Fourteen able-bodied individuals were trained on two separate sessions with two devices that provided resistance to the knee (viscous and elastic) while walking on a treadmill. We measured gait biomechanics and muscle activation during training, as well as kinematic aftereffects and changes in peripheral fatigue and neural excitability after training. Results: We found the resistance type differentially altered gait kinetics during training - elastic resistance increased knee extension during stance while viscous resistance primarily affected swing. Also, viscous resistance increased power generation while elastic resistance could increase power absorption. Both devices resulted in significant kinematic and neural aftereffects. However, overground kinematic aftereffects and neural excitability did not differ between devices. Conclusion: Different resistance types can be used to alter gait biomechanics during training. While there were no resistance-specific changes in acute neural adaptation following training, it is still possible that prolonged and repeated training could produce differential effects. Significance: Resistance type alters the kinetics of functional resistance training. Prolonged and repeated training sessions on patients will be needed to further measure the effects of these devices. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Gait impairment is one of the most common disorders of patients with chronic stroke, which hugely affects the ability to carry out the activities of daily living and the quality of life. Recently, traditional rehabilitation techniques have been associated with non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, which enhance brain plasticity, with the aim of promoting recovery in patients with chronic stroke. NIBS effectiveness in improving gait parameters in patients with chronic stroke has been in several studies evaluated. Robotic devices are emerging as promising tools for the treatment of stroke-related disabilities by performing repetitive, intensive, and task-specific treatments and have been proved to be effective for the enhancement of motor recovery in patients with chronic stroke. To date, several studies have examined the combination of NIBS with robotic-assisted gait training, but the effectiveness of this approach is not yet well established. The main purpose of this systematic review is to clarify whether the combination of NIBS and robot-assisted gait training may improve walking function in patients with chronic stroke. Our systematic review was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies eligible for review were identified through PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and PEDro from inception to March 15, 2021, and the outcomes considered were gait assessments. Seven studies were included in the qualitative analysis of this systematic review, with a total population of 186 patients with chronic stroke. All studies specified technical characteristics of robotic devices and NIBS used, with high heterogeneity of protocols. Methodological studies have shown a significantly greater improvement in walking capacity recorded with 6MWT. Finally, research studies have highlighted a positive effect on walking recovery by combination of robot-assisted gait training with non-invasive brain stimulation. Furthermore, future studies should identify the best characteristics of the combined therapeutic protocols. © 2022 Bressi, Cinnera, Morone, Campagnola, Cricenti, Santacaterina, Miccinilli, Zollo, Paolucci, Di Lazzaro, Sterzi and Bravi.

AB  - Background: Since birth, during the exploration of the environment to interact with objects, we exploit both the motor and sensory components of the upper limb (UL). This ability to integrate sensory and motor information is often compromised following a stroke. However, to date, rehabilitation protocols are focused primarily on recovery of motor function through physical therapies. Therefore, we have planned a clinical trial to investigate the effect on functionality of UL after a sensorimotor transcranial stimulation (real vs sham) in add-on to robot-assisted therapy in the stroke population. Methods: A randomised double-blind controlled trial design involving 32 patients with a single chronic stroke (onset > 180 days) was planned. Each patient will undergo 15 consecutive sessions (5 days for 3 weeks) of paired associative stimulation (PAS) coupled with UL robot-assisted therapy. PAS stimulation will be administered using a bifocal transcranial magnetic stimulator (TMS) on the posterior-parietal cortex and the primary motor area (real or sham) of the lesioned hemisphere. Clinical, kinematics and neurophysiological changes will be evaluated at the end of protocol and at 1-month follow-up and compared with baseline. The Fugl-Meyer assessment scale will be the primary outcome. Secondly, kinematic variables will be recorded during the box-and-block test and reaching tasks using video analysis and inertial sensors. Single pulse TMS and electroencephalography will be used to investigate the changes in local cortical reactivity and in the interconnected areas. Discussion: The presented trial shall evaluate with a multimodal approach the effects of sensorimotor network stimulation applied before a robot-assisted therapy training on functional recovery of the upper extremity after stroke. The combination of neuromodulation and robot-assisted therapy can promote an increase of cortical plasticity of sensorimotor areas followed by a clinical benefit in the motor function of the upper limb.

AB  - Because of their unique adaptability, flexibility, and robustness, musculoskeletal robotic systems are regarded potentially as next-generation robots. However, motion learning and generation of such a robotic system are still challenging. This paper presents a neuromuscular control method, namely, TMS-PPO, based on time-varying muscle synergy (TMS) and proximal policy optimization (PPO). The electromyogram (EMG) activation signals of actual human motions are decomposed to obtain TMSs based on the temporal properties of the TMS. The weights of networks are trained to generate the scale and phase coefficients through the PPO. The coefficients modulate the TMSs to generate appropriate activation patterns to optimize motion learning of the musculoskeletal system. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the TMSs are extracted from human upper limb muscle activation signals, and we compare TMS-PPO with PPO in the motion learning and generation process of an upper limb musculoskeletal system. The results show that TMS-PPO can complete the control tasks because the average errors of the joints are less than 0.05 rad. In the meantime, TMSs are used as motion primitives of the musculoskeletal system to simulate the process of the human CNS controlling muscles. It shows that TMS-PPO reduces the energy consumption and improves the learning rate significantly compared with the PPO. The learning episodes reduce from 104 to 103, which indicates that TMS-PPO has a stronger learning ability and better physiological explanation.Note to Practitioners - Due to the superiorities of the musculoskeletal system, humanoid robots that imitate human driven mechanisms are vigorously carried out worldwide. Taking advantages of human-like characteristics, the musculoskeletal robot provides new opportunities to understand and validate the human mechanisms of muscle control and motion learning, to compare the performance of the robot to that of humans as well as work in real world, e.g., human interactive robots, amusement robots and medical training robots in the future. However, strong redundancy, coupling, and nonlinearity of the system also raises many challenges for the investigation of the control problem. Inspired by how the human CNS controls a musculoskeletal system and realize motion generalization, a novel muscle-synergies-based neuromuscular control that combines time-varying muscle synergy (TMS) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), namely, TMS-PPO is proposed in this paper. The learning efficiency of PPO and the physiological interpretation of the control process are improved during the motion learning and generation processes of the musculoskeletal system. Preliminary simulation experiments suggest that this method is feasible in terms of control accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the performance of the TMS-PPO is comparable to the PPO without significant improvement. To solve this problem, in future work, we will introduce the cerebellar model into the control method which plays the role of adjusting and correcting the motions of the limbs to achieve accurate and stable control in the actions process of humans.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Brain stimulation combined with intensive therapy may improve hand function in children with perinatal stroke-induced unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP). However, response to therapy varies and underlying neuroplasticity mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we aimed to characterize robotic motor mapping outcomes in children with UCP. Twenty-nine children with perinatal stroke and UCP (median age 11 ± 2 years) were compared to 24 typically developing controls (TDC). Robotic, neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation was employed to define bilateral motor maps including area, volume, and peak motor evoked potential (MEP). Map outcomes were compared to the primary clinical outcome of the Jebsen–Taylor Test of Hand Function (JTT). Maps were reliably obtained in the contralesional motor cortex (24/29) but challenging in the lesioned hemisphere (5/29). Within the contralesional M1 of participants with UCP, area and peak MEP amplitude of the unaffected map were larger than the affected map. When comparing bilateral maps within the contralesional M1 in children with UCP to that of TDC, only peak MEP amplitudes were different, being smaller for the affected hand as compared to TDC. We observed correlations between the unaffected map when stimulating the contralesional M1 and function of the unaffected hand. Robotic motor mapping can characterize motor cortex neurophysiology in children with perinatal stroke. Map area and peak MEP amplitude may represent discrete biomarkers of developmental plasticity in the contralesional M1. Correlations between map metrics and hand function suggest clinical relevance and utility in studies of interventional plasticity. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Communicative gaze (e.g., mutual or averted) has been shown to affect attentional orienting. However, no study to date has clearly separated the neural basis of the pure social component that modulates attentional orienting in response to communicative gaze from other processes that might be a combination of attentional and social effects. We used TMS to isolate the purely social effects of communicative gaze on attentional orienting. Participants completed a gaze-cueing task with a humanoid robot who engaged either in mutual or in averted gaze before shifting its gaze. Before the task, participants received either sham stimulation (baseline), stimulation of right TPJ (rTPJ), or dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Results showed, as expected, that communicative gaze affected attentional orienting in baseline condition. This effect was not evident for rTPJ stimulation. Interestingly, stimulation to rTPJ also canceled out attentional orienting altogether. On the other hand, dmPFC stimulation eliminated the social ly driven difference in attention orienting between the two gaze conditions while maintaining the basic general attentional orienting effect. Thus, our results allowed for separation of the pure social effect of communicative gaze on attentional orienting from other processes that are a combination of social and generic attentional components. © 2023 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Gait recovery is a fundamental goal in patients with spinal cord injury to attain greater autonomy and quality of life. Robotics is becoming a valid tool in improving motor, balance, and gait function in this patient population. Moreover, other innovative approaches are leading to promising results. The aim of this study was to investigate new rehabilitative methods for gait recovery in people who have suffered spinal cord injuries. A systematic review of the last 10 years of the literature was performed in three databases (PubMed, PEDro, andCochrane). We followed this PICO of the review: P: adults with non-progressive spinal cord injury; I: new rehabilitative methods; C: new methods vs. conventional methods; and O: improvement of gait parameters. When feasible, a comparison through ES forest plots was performed. A total of 18 RCTs of the 599 results obtained were included. The studies investigated robotic rehabilitation (n = 10), intermittent hypoxia (N = 3) and external stimulation (N = 5). Six studies of the first group (robotic rehabilitation) were compared using a forest plot for 10MWT, LEMS, WISCI-II, and SCIM-3. The other clinical trials were analyzed through a narrative review of the results. We found weak evidence for the claim that robotic devices lead to better outcomes in gait independence compared to conventional rehabilitation methods. External stimulation and intermittent hypoxia seem to improve gait parameters associated with other rehabilitation methods. Research investigating the role of innovative technologies in improving gait and balance is needed since walking ability is a fundamental issue in patients with SCI. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - (1) Background: This systematic review aimed to focus on the effects of rehabilitation interventions combined with noninvasive brain stimulation on upper limb motor function in stroke patients. (2) Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, and CINAHL were used for the literature research. Articles were searched using the following terms: “Stroke OR CVA OR cerebrovascular accident” AND “upper limb OR upper extremity” AND “NIBS OR Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation” OR “rTMS” OR “repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation” OR “tDCS” OR “transcranial direct current stimulation” AND “RCT” OR randomized control trial.” In total, 12 studies were included in the final analysis. (3) Results: Analysis using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale for qualitative evaluation of the literature rated eight articles as “excellent” and four as “good.” Combined rehabilitation interventions included robotic therapy, motor imagery using brain–computer interaction, sensory control, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, task-oriented approach, task-oriented mirror therapy, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and behavior observation therapy. (4) Conclusions: Although it is difficult to estimate the recovery of upper limb motor function in stroke patients treated with noninvasive brain stimulation alone, a combination of a task-oriented approach, occupational therapy, action observation, wrist robot-assisted rehabilitation, and physical therapy can be effective. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: Magnetic resonance imaging–guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRIgLITT) has been proven safe and effective for the treatment of focal epilepsy of different etiologies. It has also been used to disconnect brain tissue in more extensive or diffuse epilepsy, such as corpus callosotomy and hemispherotomy. Methods: In this study, we report a case of temporo-parieto-occipital disconnection surgery performed using MRIgLITT assisted by a robotic arm for refractory epilepsy of the posterior quadrant. A highly realistic cadaver simulation was performed before the actual surgery. Results: The patient was a 14-year-old boy whose seizures began at the age of 8. The epilepsy was a result of a left perinatal ischemic event that caused a porencephalic cyst, and despite receiving multiple antiepileptic drugs, the patient continued to experience daily seizures which led to the recommendation of surgery. Conclusions: A Wada test lateralized language in the right hemisphere. Motor and sensory function was confirmed in the left hemisphere through magnetic resonance imaging functional studies and NexStim. The left MRIgLITT temporo-parieto-occipital disconnection disconnection was achieved using 5 laser fibers. The patient followed an excellent postoperative course and was seizure-free, with no additional neurological deficits 24 months after the surgery. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Hemi-spatial neglect (HSN) is a debilitating post stroke cognitive deficit resulting in reduced attention to stimuli presented in the contra-lateral hemi-visual field. It adversely impacts patient's medical recovery, activities of daily living and quality of life. Early referral to Rehabilitation Medicine specialist for thorough evaluation, prompt recognition of functional impairments and formulation of a comprehensive rehabilitation plan unique to patient is important. It is part of the comprehensive and holistic management of stroke patients with HSN. We summarize the current management strategies used for post-stroke HSN rehabilitation with the options including non-invasive brain stimulation, visuomotor feedback training, robotic rehabilitation and trans-dermal nicotine patch. © 2022 Pakistan Medical Association.

AB  - This study proposes a new software platform, called ROS2-TMS, for an informationally structured environment. An informationally structured environment is vital for developing intelligent service robots by embedding various sensors in the environment to enhance the sensing capability and intelligence of robots. Thus far, we have been developing a software platform, named ROS-TMS, for an informationally structured environment, which connects various sensors and robots using ROS architecture. In recent years, ROS2, a next-generation version of ROS, has been released. ROS2 has many advantages, such as enhanced security, QoS control, and support for various platforms. ROS2-TMS, a new version of ROS-TMS, is developed not only by porting existing modules in ROS-TMS, such as the control system for a communication robot, but also by adding useful functions utilizing new features in ROS2. For instance, we added a voice user interface to control robots and various devices in the environment, such as lights or a bed. In addition, we implemented a new task scheduler that provides a cancelation function to stop running tasks and improve the security of the platform. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Although much is known about cognitive dysfunction in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), few studies have examined the pathophysiology of disordered motor circuitry. We explored differences in neurometabolite levels and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)–derived corticomotor representations among children with ADHD and typically developing children. Methods: We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) protocols to measure excitatory (glutamate + glutamine [Glx]) and inhibitory (γ-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) neurometabolite levels in the dominant primary motor cortex (M1) and the supplementary motor area (SMA) in children with ADHD and typically developing children. We used robotic neuronavigated TMS to measure corticospinal excitability and create corticomotor maps. Results: We collected data from 26 medication-free children with ADHD (aged 7–16 years) and 25 typically developing children (11–16 years). Children with ADHD had lower M1 Glx (p = 0.044, d = 0.6); their mean resting motor threshold was lower (p = 0.029, d = 0.8); their map area was smaller (p = 0.044, d = 0.7); and their hotspot density was higher (p = 0.008, d = 0.9). M1 GABA levels were associated with motor map area (p = 0.036). Limitations: Some TMS data were lost because the threshold of some children exceeded 100% of the machine output. The relatively large MRS voxel required to obtain sufficient signal-to-noise ratio and reliably measure GABA levels encompassed tissue beyond the M1, making this measure less anatomically specific. Conclusion: The neurochemistry and neurophysiology of key nodes in the motor network may be altered in children with ADHD, and the differences appear to be related to each other. These findings suggest potentially novel neuropharmacological and neuromodulatory targets for ADHD. © 2022 CMA Impact Inc.

AB  - Restoration of underwater images plays a vital role in underwater target detection and recognition, underwater robots, underwater rescue, sea organism monitoring, marine geological survey, and real-time navigation. Mostly, physics-based optimization methods do not incorporate structural differences between the guidance and transmission maps (TMs) which affect the performance. In this paper, we propose a method for underwater image restoration by utilizing a robust regularization of coherent structures. The proposed method incorporates the potential structural differences between TM and the guidance map. The optimization of TM is modeled through a nonconvex energy function which consists of data and smoothness terms. The initial TM is taken as a data term whereas the smoothness term contains static and dynamic structural priors. Finally, the optimization problem is solved using majorize-minimize (MM) algorithm. The proposed method is tested on benchmark dataset and its performance is compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The results from the experiments indicate that the proposed regularization scheme adequately improves the TM, which results in high-quality restored images. Copyright © 2022 Ali and Mahmood.

AB  - Pediatric stroke (PS) is an injury caused by the occlusion or rupture of a blood vessel in the central nervous system (CNS) of children, before or after birth. Hemiparesis is the most common motoric deficit associated with PS in children. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that PS is a significant challenge for rehabilitation, especially since the consequences may also appear during the child’s growth and development, reducing functional capacity. The plasticity of the child’s CNS is an important predecessor of recovery, but disruption of the neural network, specific to an immature brain, can have harmful and potentially devastating consequences. In this review, we summarize the complexity of the consequences associated with PS and the possibilities and role of modern rehabilitation. An analysis of the current literature reveals that Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy, forced-use therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, functional electrical stimulation and robot-assisted therapy have demonstrated at least partial improvements in motor domains related to hemiparesis or hemiplegia caused by PS, but they are supported with different levels of evidence. Due to the lack of randomized controlled studies, the optimal rehabilitation treatment is still debatable, and therefore, most recommendations are primarily based on expert consensuses, opinions and an insufficient level of evidence. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: To understand the benefits and harms of physical activity in people who may require a wheelchair with a focus on people with multiple sclerosis (MS), cerebral palsy (CP), and spinal cord injury (SCI). Data Sources: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Embase (January 2008 through November 2020). Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized trials, and cohort studies of observed physical activity (at least 10 sessions on 10 days) in participants with MS, CP, and SCI. Data Extraction: We conducted dual data abstraction, quality assessment, and strength of evidence. Measures of physical functioning are reported individually where sufficient data exist and grouped as “function” where data are scant. Data Synthesis: No studies provided evidence for prevention of cardiovascular conditions, development of diabetes, or obesity. Among 168 included studies, 44% enrolled participants with MS (38% CP, 18% SCI). Studies in MS found walking ability may be improved with treadmill training and multimodal exercises; function may be improved with treadmill, balance exercises, and motion gaming; balance is likely improved with balance exercises and may be improved with aquatic exercises, robot-assisted gait training (RAGT), motion gaming, and multimodal exercises; activities of daily living (ADL), female sexual function, and spasticity may be improved with aquatic therapy; sleep may be improved with aerobic exercises and aerobic fitness with multimodal exercises. In CP, balance may be improved with hippotherapy and motion gaming; function may be improved with cycling, treadmill, and hippotherapy. In SCI, ADL may be improved with RAGT. Conclusions: Depending on population and type of exercise, physical activity was associated with improvements in walking, function, balance, depression, sleep, ADL, spasticity, female sexual function, and aerobic capacity. Few harms of physical activity were reported in studies. Future studies are needed to address evidence gaps and to confirm findings. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Motor and cognitive rehabilitation in individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a growing field of clinical and research interest. In fact, novel rehabilitative approaches allow a very early verticalization and gait training through robotic devices and other innovative tools boosting neuroplasticity, thanks to the high-intensity, repetitive and task-oriented training. In the same way, cognitive rehabilitation is also evolving towards advanced interventions using virtual reality (VR), computer-based approaches, telerehabilitation and neuromodulation devices. This review aimed to systematically investigate the existing evidence concerning the role of innovative technologies in the motor and cognitive neurorehabilitation of TBI patients. We searched and reviewed the studies published in the Cochrane Library, PEDro, PubMed and Scopus between January 2012 and September 2022. After an accurate screening, only 29 papers were included in this review. This systematic review has demonstrated the beneficial role of innovative technologies when applied to cognitive rehabilitation in patients with TBI, while evidence of their effect on motor rehabilitation in this patient population is poor and still controversial. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Stroke has been one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and is still a social health issue. Keeping in view the importance of physical rehabilitation of stroke patients, an analytical review has been compiled in which different therapies have been reviewed for their effectiveness, such as functional electric stimulation (FES), noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) including transcranial direct current stimulation (t-DCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (t-MS), invasive epidural cortical stimulation, virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation, task-oriented therapy, robot-assisted training, tele rehabilitation, and cerebral plasticity for the rehabilitation of upper extremity motor impairment. New therapeutic rehabilitation techniques are also being investigated, such as VR. This literature review mainly focuses on the randomized controlled studies, reviews, and statistical meta-analyses associated with motor rehabilitation after stroke. Moreover, with the increasing prevalence rate and the adverse socio-economic consequences of stroke, a statistical analysis covering its economic factors such as treatment, medication and post-stroke care services, and risk factors (modifiable and non-modifiable) have also been discussed. This review suggests that if the prevalence rate of the disease remains persistent, a considerable increase in the stroke population is expected by 2025, causing a substantial economic burden on society, as the survival rate of stroke is high compared to other diseases. Compared to all the other therapies, VR has now emerged as the modern approach towards rehabilitation motor activity of impaired limbs. A range of randomized controlled studies and experimental trials were reviewed to analyse the effectiveness of VR as a rehabilitative treatment with considerable satisfactory results. However, more clinical controlled trials are required to establish a strong evidence base for VR to be widely accepted as a preferred rehabilitation therapy for stroke. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a neurostimulation technique based on the principle of electromagnetic induction of an electric field in the brain with both research and clinical applications. To produce an optimal neuro-modulatory effect, TMS coil must be placed on the head and oriented accurately with respect to the region of interest within the brain. A robotic method can enhance the accuracy and facilitate the procedure for TMS coil placement. This work presents two system improvements for robot-assisted TMS (RA-TMS) application. Previous systems have used outside-in tracking method where a stationary external infrared (IR) tracker is used as a reference point to track the head and TMS coil positions. This method is prone to losing track of the coil or the head if the IR camera is blocked by the robotic arm during its motion. To address this issue, we implemented an inside-out tracking method by mounting a portable IR camera on the robot end-effector. This method guarantees that the line of sight of the IR camera is not obscured by the robotic arm at any time during its motion. We also integrated a portable projection mapping device (PPMD) into the RA-TMS system to provide visual guidance during TMS application. PPMD can track the head via an IR tracker, and can project a planned contact point of TMS coil on the head or overlay the underlying brain anatomy in real-time. © 2022 SPIE.

AB  - ptimization of delivery of goods to production stations spread on factory floors has led to creation of Automated Guided Vehicles AGV. Latter it evolved to AGVs equipped with collaborative robots implemented to automate the process of loading and unloading of the transported goods. To make the operation of AGVs efficient it is needed to exchange data with higher level system like Manufacturing Execution Systems MES and Transport Management Systems TMS. The data is needed also to increase the energy efficiency of AGVs and their availability by implementation of predictive maintenance procedures. To make it possible processing of big data sets describing the change of the state of AGV's in time is necessary. But first, the data has to be gathered using reliable wireless communication link that are shared with real-time protocols used for integration with production stations and collaboration with them. The paper considers a solution based on EtherCAT network with application of Ethernet over EtherCAT EoE communication profile for tunneling of OPC UA traffic.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive and painless technique used in both clinical trials and research on cortical activity and brain networks. TMS involves the use of an electromagnetic coil, which can induce powerful but brief magnetic pulses. When the coil is headed against the scalp, it can induce electrical activity in underlying brain tissue. For effective results, the TMS coil should be in appropriate contact with patients' scalp and positioned for consistent stimulation. In many cases, it requires researchers and clinicians to not only hold and position the coil on subjects' head, also to take care to ensure appropriate and consistent contact between the TMS coil and subject's scalp. This task is noticeably tiresome for the operators considering weight of the coil and a dense cable attached to it. On the other side, the patient or participant has to sit motionless; otherwise, the contact will be lost and the stimulation will have a reduced impact. In this paper, we propose and develop a haptically-enabled teleoperated robotic platform that removes all those limitations and burdensome from both TMS operators and patients/participants. The operator, through a haptic interface, remotely controls a robotic arm holding the coil. This system provides the operator with the sense of touch to feel the contact force between the coil and patient/participant's head. Therefore, operators and patients/participants do not need to be in the same location while conducting TMS, including the 'motor thresholding' procedure. This will offer a huge benefit to the healthcare services in rural areas. Experimental evaluations carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robotic system.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The prospect of direct interaction between the brain and computers has been investigated in recent decades, revealing several potential applications. One of these is sight restoration in profoundly blind people, which is based on the ability to elicit visual perceptions while directly stimulating the occipital cortex. Technological innovation has led to the development of microelectrodes implantable on the brain surface. The feasibility of implanting a microelectrode on the visual cortex has already been shown in animals, with promising results. Current research has focused on the implantation of microelectrodes into the occipital brain of blind volunteers. The technique raises several technical challenges. In this technical note, the authors suggest a safe and effective approach for robot-assisted implantation of microelectrodes in the occipital lobe for sight restoration. © AANS 2024, except where prohibited by US copyright law.

AB  - During the past century, we have seen the development of several therapeutic approaches for the treatment of adults with various neurological deficits. In the early to the middle part of the twentieth century, therapeutic approach for handling neurological conditions was largely orthopedic that emphasized on surgery, strengthening the weak muscles, and use of splints. By the late 1940s to early 1960s, a swing towards a neurological emphasis characterized by development of techniques based on neurophysiological and motor learning principles was observed. Approaches developed by Rood, Brunnström, Bobath and Bobath, and Knot and Voss were instances for the same. From the 1980s the emphasis moved away from the neurodevelopmental approaches towards non-neurodevelopmental approaches like motor relearning program and constraint-induced movement therapy and currently, the technological advancement has paved the way to novel concepts like the use of virtual reality, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and robotics in the field of neurological rehabilitation. As yet, there is no scientific evidence that clearly supports that any standalone approach is superior to another. The gamut of research including systematic and meta-analysis studies has shown minimal to moderate improvement for few approaches when delivered as a standalone treatment and for most the sample size or methodology was not rigorous enough to demand a change in practice. Therapists must have adequate knowledge, both theoretical and practical, about various therapeutic approaches to provide an eclectic treatment program. Since all these approaches have strengths and weaknesses of their own and collectively have the edge over a standalone, an eclectic approach makes it all the more meaningful to tackle most of the sensorimotor dysfunctions among patients. The author believes that the knowledge earned from each scientific therapeutic approach must serve as a reservoir from which a clinician can wisely choose the necessary tools to customize the eclectic treatment program to suit the specific needs of patients. Choosing the best treatment methods to address the patient’s sensorimotor issues must be the most rational approach when substantial evidence for the effectiveness of any single approach over the others is unavailable. Based on the patient’s abilities and requirements, the therapists need to carefully select the strategies that have the greatest chance of successfully remediating existing impairments and promoting functional recovery. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which arose in late 2019, caused extensive destruction, impacting a substantial proportion of the worldwide population and leading to millions of deaths. Although COVID-19 is mainly linked to respiratory and pulmonary complications, it has the potential to affect neurologic structures as well. Neurological involvement may manifest as minimal and reversible; however, a notable proportion of cases have exhibited pronounced neurological consequences, such as strokes. Endothelial inflammation, hypercoagulation, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system alterations, and cardiogenic embolism are the pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke under COVID-19 circumstances. Physical activity and exercise have improved several aspects of post-stroke recovery, including cardiovascular health, walking capacity, and upper limb strength. They are commonly used to assist stroke survivors in overcoming their motor restrictions. Furthermore, stroke rehabilitation can incorporate a range of specific techniques, including body-weight-supported treadmill applications, constraint-induced movement therapy, robotic rehabilitation interventions, transcranial direct current stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and prism adaptation training. Under pandemic conditions, there were several barriers to neurological rehabilitation. The most significant of these were individual’s fear of infection, which caused them to postpone their rehabilitation applications and rehabilitation areas being converted into COVID-19 units. The primary emphasis had turned to COVID-19 treatment. Several valuable data and views were gained in reorganizing rehabilitation during the pandemic, contributing to establishing future views in this regard. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Dedicated fieldbuses were developed to provide temporal determinisms for industrial distributed real-time systems. In the early stages, communication systems were dedicated to a single protocol and generally supported a single service. Industrial Ethernet, which is used today, supports many concurrent services, but usually only one real-time protocol at a time. However, shop-floor communication must support a range of different traffic from messages with strict real-time requirements such as time-driven messages with process data and event-driven security messages to diagnostic messages that have more relaxed temporal requirements. Thus, it is necessary to combine different real-time protocols into one communication network. This raises many challenges, especially when the goal is to use wireless communication. There is no research work on that area and this paper attempts to fill in that gap. It is a result of some experiments that were conducted while connecting a Collaborative Robot CoBotAGV with a production station for which two real-time protocols, Profinet and OPC UA, had to be combined into one wireless network interface. The first protocol was for the exchange of processing data, while the latter integrated the vehicle with Manufacturing Execution System (MES) and Transport Management System (TMS). The paper presents the real-time capabilities of such a combination—an achievable communication cycle and jitter. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The mechanism of stroke recovery is related to the reorganization of cerebral activity that can be enhanced by rehabilitation therapy. Two well established treatments are Robot-Assisted Therapy (RT) and Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT), however, it is unknown whether there is a difference in the neuroplastic changes induced by these therapies, and if the modifications are related to motor improvement. Therefore, this study aims to identify neurophysiological biomarkers related to motor improvement of participants with chronic stroke that received RT or CIMT, and to test whether there is a difference in neuronal changes induced by these two therapies. Methods: This study included participants with chronic stroke that took part in a pilot experiment to compare CIMT vs. RT. Neurophysiological evaluations were performed with electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), pre and post rehabilitation therapy. Motor function was measured by the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) and Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Limb (FMA-UL). Results: Twenty-seven participants with chronic stroke completed the present study [mean age of 58.8 years (SD ± 13.6), mean time since stroke of 18.2 months (SD ± 9.6)]. We found that changes in motor threshold (MT) and motor evoked potential (MEP) in the lesioned hemisphere have a positive and negative correlation with WMFT improvement, respectively. The absolute change in alpha peak in the unlesioned hemisphere and the absolute change of the alpha ratio (unlesioned/lesioned hemisphere) is negatively correlated with WMFT improvement. The decrease of EEG power ratio (increase in the lesioned hemisphere and decrease in the unlesioned hemisphere) for high alpha bandwidths is correlated with better improvement in WMFT. The variable “type of treatment (RT or CIMT)” was not significant in the models. Conclusion: Our results suggest that distinct treatments (RT and CIMT) have similar neuroplastic mechanisms of recovery. Moreover, motor improvements in participants with chronic stroke are related to decreases of cortical excitability in the lesioned hemisphere measured with TMS. Furthermore, the balance of both EEG power and EEG alpha peak frequency in the lesioned hemisphere is related to motor improvement. Copyright © 2023 Simis, Thibaut, Imamura, Battistella and Fregni.

AB  - The Stroop task is a well-established tool to investigate the influence of competing visual categories on decision making. Neuroimaging as well as rTMS studies have demonstrated the involvement of parietal structures, particularly the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), in this task. Given its reliability, the numerical Stroop task was used to compare the effects of different TMS targeting approaches by Sack and colleagues (Sack AT 2009), who elegantly demonstrated the superiority of individualized fMRI targeting. We performed the present study to test whether fMRI-guided rTMS effects on numerical Stroop task performance could still be observed while using more advanced techniques that have emerged in the last decade (e.g., electrical sham, robotic coil holder system, etc.). To do so we used a traditional reaction time analysis and we performed, post-hoc, a more advanced comprehensive drift diffusion modeling approach. Fifteen participants performed the numerical Stroop task while active or sham 10 Hz rTMS was applied over the region of the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) showing the strongest functional activation in the Incongruent > Congruent contrast. This target was determined based on individualized fMRI data collected during a separate session. Contrary to our assumption, the classical reaction time analysis did not show any superiority of active rTMS over sham, probably due to confounds such as potential cumulative rTMS effects, and the effect of practice. However, the modeling approach revealed a robust effect of rTMS on the drift rate variable, suggesting differential processing of congruent and incongruent properties in perceptual decision-making, and more generally, illustrating that more advanced computational analysis of performance can elucidate the effects of rTMS on the brain where simpler methods may not. © 2024 Public Library of Science.

AB  - Neurorehabilitation devices and technologies are crucial for enhancing stroke recovery. These include noninvasive brain stimulation devices that provide repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation, which can remodulate an injured brain. Technologies such as robotics, virtual reality, and telerehabilitation are suitable add-ons or complements to physical therapy. However, the appropriate application of these devices and technologies, which target specific deficits and stages, for stroke therapy must be clarified. Accordingly, a literature review was conducted to evaluate the theoretical and practical evidence on the use of neurorehabilitation devices and technologies for stroke therapy. This narrative review provides a practical guide for the use of neurorehabilitation devices and describes the implications of use and potential integration of these devices into healthcare. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) motor mapping is a safe, non-invasive method used to study corticomotor organization and intervention-induced plasticity. Reliability of resting maps is well established, but understudied for active maps and unestablished for active maps obtained using robotic TMS techniques. The objective of this study was to determine the reliability of robotic neuro-navigated TMS motor map measures during active muscle contraction. We hypothesized that map area and volume would show excellent short- and medium-term reliability. Twenty healthy adults were tested on 3 days. Active maps of the first dorsal interosseous muscle were created using a 12 × 12 grid (7 mm spacing). Short- (24 h) and medium-term (3–5 weeks) relative (intra-class correlation coefficient) and absolute (minimal detectable change (MDC); standard error of measure) reliabilities were evaluated for map area, volume, center of gravity (CoG), and hotspot magnitude (peak-to-peak MEP amplitude at the hotspot), along with active motor threshold (AMT) and maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). This study found that AMT and MVC had good-to-excellent short- and medium-term reliability. Map CoG (x and y) were the most reliable map measures across sessions with excellent short- and medium-term reliability (p < 0.001). Map area, hotspot magnitude, and map volume followed with better reliability medium-term than short-term, with a change of 28%, 62%, and 78% needed to detect a true medium-term change, respectively. Therefore, robot-guided neuro-navigated TMS active mapping is relatively reliable but varies across measures. This, and MDC, should be considered in interventional study designs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Many approaches to stroke recovery being studied show promise. However, at this time methodological variation between studies is substantial, and the field lacks a sufficient understanding of the mechanisms of stroke recovery therapeutics to personalize interventions and to fully interpret treatment failures. These gaps promote questions of when to give particular treatments, their effective doses, who responds, and effects of combining interventions. © 2021 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - Background: Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) creates a state with increased excitability that permits treatment modalities to induce neuroplasticity and motor learning. Continuous theta burst stimulation before iTBS may induce metaplasticity and boost the facilitatory effect of iTBS. This study investigated the effects of priming iTBS (ie, applying continuous theta burst stimulation before iTBS) on poststroke hemiparetic upper limb recovery. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 42 patients with chronic stroke were recruited and randomly allocated to 10 sessions of either priming iTBS, nonpriming iTBS, or sham stimulation to the ipsilesional motor cortex, immediately before robot-assisted training. Outcomes included Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity, Action Research Arm Test and mean movement velocity during each robot-assisted training session. Twenty-one patients were enrolled for measuring the sensorimotor beta event-related desynchronization induced by either mirror visual feedback or movement. Results: The Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity scores revealed a significant time-by-group interaction (P=0.011). Priming and nonpriming iTBS were both superior to sham stimulation in post hoc comparisons; however, the superiority was diminished at follow-up. Among patients with a higher functioning upper limb, priming iTBS yielded a significantly greater improvement in Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity scores than nonpriming iTBS (P=0.025) and sham stimulation (P=0.029) did. No significant interaction was found when analyzing the Action Research Arm Test and mean movement velocity. Priming iTBS enhanced the patients' mirror visual feedback-induced high beta sensorimotor event-related desynchronization over their ipsilesional hemisphere. Conclusions: Priming and nonpriming iTBS are both superior to sham stimulation in enhancing treatment gains from robot-assisted training, and patients with a higher functioning upper limb may experience more benefits from priming iTBS. Priming iTBS may facilitate poststroke motor learning by enhancing the permissiveness of the ipsilesional sensorimotor area to therapeutic sensory modalities, such as the mirror visual feedback.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) motor mapping is a safe, non-invasive method that can be used to study corticomotor organization. Motor maps are typically acquired at rest, and comparisons to maps obtained during muscle activation have been both limited and contradictory. Understanding the relationship between functional activation of the corticomotor system as recorded by motor mapping is crucial for their use clinically and in research. The present study utilized robotic TMS paired with personalized neuro-navigation to examine the relationship between resting and active motor map measures and their relationship with motor performance. Twenty healthy right-handed participants underwent resting and active robotic TMS motor mapping of the first dorsal interosseous to 10% maximum voluntary contraction. Motor map parameters including map area, volume, and measures of map centrality were compared between techniques using paired sample tests of difference and Bland–Altman plots and analysis. Map area, volume, and hotspot magnitude were larger in the active motor maps, while map center of gravity and hotspot locations remained consistent between both maps. No associations were observed between motor maps and motor performance as measured by the Purdue Pegboard Test. Our findings support previous suggestions that maps scale with muscle contraction. Differences in mapping outcomes suggest rest and active motor maps may reflect functionally different corticomotor representations. Advanced analysis methods may better characterize the underlying neurophysiology of both types of motor mapping. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Cervical spine deformities can occur because of genetic, congenital, inflammatory, degenerative, or iatrogenic causes. Case Report: We report a 45-year-old woman who presented to our clinic with complete paralysis of the left upper extremity 5 months after C4-C6 discectomy and fusion surgery. The electrodiagnostic and EMG reports 3 months after her previous surgery revealed left C5-C7 polyradiculopathy involving the upper trunk, lateral and posterior cords, and atrophy of the left deltoids, triceps, and biceps muscles. She underwent the following nerve transfer procedures with the senior author (RKN): The median nerve fascicles were transferred to the biceps and bra-chialis branches of the musculocutaneous nerve. Radial nerve triceps branches were transferred to the deltoid and teres minor branches of the axillary nerve. The patient could fully abduct her left shoulder to 170°, and the LUE functions were restored to nearly normal 17 months after the surgery. Conclusions: Neurolysis combined with nerve transfer might be the most effective treatment for cervical spinal root inju-ries. Advances in peripheral nerve rewiring, transcranial magnetic stimulation, brain-computer interface robot-ic technologies, and emerging rehabilitation will undoubtedly increase the possibility of reviving the extremi-ties in patients with central pathology by restoring the descending motor signals through the residual neural network connections. © Am J Case Rep, 2023.

AB  - Metals—especially iron, copper and manganese—are important elements of brain functions and development. Metal-dysregulation homeostasis is associated with brain-structure damage to the motor, cognitive and emotional systems, and leads to neurodegenerative processes. There is more and more evidence that specialized cognitive and motor exercises can enhance brain function and attenuate neurodegeneration in mechanisms, such as improving neuroplasticity by altering the synaptic structure and function in many brain regions. Psychological and physical methods of rehabilitation are now becoming increasingly important, as pharmacological treatments for movement, cognitive and emotional symptoms are limited. The present study describes physical and cognitive rehabilitation methods of patients associated with metal-induced neurotoxicity such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease and Wilson’s dis-ease. In our review, we describe physical (e.g., virtual-reality environments, robotic-assists training) and psychological (cognitive training, cognitive stimulation, neuropsychological rehabilitation and cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness-based therapies) methods, significantly improving the quality of life and independence of patients associated with storage diseases. Storage diseases are a diverse group of hereditary metabolic defects characterized by the abnormal cumulation of storage material in cells. This topic is being addressed due to the fact that rehabilitation plays a vital role in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately so far there are no specific guidelines concerning physiotherapy in neurodegenerative disorders, especially in regards to duration of exercise, type of exercise and intensity, as well as frequency of exercise. This is in part due to the variety of symptoms of these diseases and the various levels of disease progression. This further proves the need for more research to be carried out on the role of exercise in neurodegenerative disorder treatment. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Motor hotspot identification represents the first step in the determination of the motor threshold and is the basis for the specification of stimulation intensity used for various Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) applications. The level of experimenters’ experience and the methodology of motor hotspot identification differ between laboratories. The need for an optimized and time-efficient technique for motor hotspot identification is therefore substantial. Objective: With the current work, we present a framework for an optimized and time-efficient semi-automated motor hotspot search (SAMHS) technique utilizing a neuronavigated robot-assisted TMS system (TMS-cobot). Furthermore, we aim to test its practicality and accuracy by a comparison with a manual motor hotspot identification method. Method: A total of 32 participants took part in this dual-center study. At both study centers, participants underwent manual hotspot search (MHS) with an experienced TMS researcher, and the novel SAMHS procedure with a TMS-cobot (hereafter, called cobot hotspot search, CHS) in a randomized order. Resting motor threshold (RMT), and stimulus intensity to produce 1 mV (SI1mV) peak-to-peak of motor-evoked potential (MEP), as well as MEPs with 120% RMT and SI1mV were recorded as outcome measures for comparison. Results: Compared to the MHS method, the CHS produced lower RMT, lower SI1mV and a trend-wise higher peak-to-peak MEP amplitude in stimulations with SI1mV. The duration of the CHS procedure was longer than that of the MHS (15.60 vs. 2.43 min on average). However, accuracy of the hotspot was higher for the CHS compared to the MHS. Conclusions: The SAMHS procedure introduces an optimized motor hotspot determination system that is easy to use, and strikes a fairly good balance between accuracy and speed. This new procedure can thus be deplored by experienced as well as beginner-level TMS researchers.

AB  - Purpose of Review: There continue to be a plethora of approaches to the rehabilitation of hemispatial inattention, from different forms of sensory stimulation (visual, auditory and somatosensory feedback), through all major modes of non-invasive brain stimulation to drug therapies. Here we summarise trials published in the years 2017–2022 and tabulate their effect sizes, with the aim of drawing on common themes that may serve to inform future rehabilitative studies. Recent Findings: Immersive virtual reality approaches to visual stimulation seem well tolerated, although they have yet to yield any clinically relevant improvements. Dynamic auditory stimulation looks very promising and has high potential for implementation. Robotic interventions are limited by their cost and are perhaps best suited to patients with a co-occurring hemiparesis. Regarding brain stimulation, rTMS continues to demonstrate moderate effects but tDCS studies have yielded disappointing results so far. Drugs, primarily aimed at the dopaminergic system, often demonstrate beneficial effects of a medium size, but as with many of the approaches, it seems difficult to predict responders and non-responders. Summary: Our main recommendation is that researchers consider incorporating single-case experimental designs into their studies as rehabilitation trials are likely to remain small in terms of patient numbers, and this is the best way to deal with all the factors that cause large between-subject heterogeneity. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Inner ear disorders' treatment remains challenging due to anatomical barriers. Robotic assistance seems to be a promising approach to enhance inner ear treatments and, more particularly, lead to effective targeted drug delivery into the human cochlea. In this paper we present a combination of a micro-macro system that was designed and realized in order to efficiently control the navigation of magnetic nanoparticles in an open-loop scheme throughout the cochlea, considering that the magnetic particles cannot be located in real time. In order to respect the anatomical constraints, we established the characteristics that the new platform must present then proceeded to the design of the latter. The developed system is composed of a magnetic actuator that aims to guide nanoparticles into the cochlea. Mounted on a robotic manipulator, it ensures its positioning around the patient's head. The magnetic device integrates four parallelepiped-rectangle permanent magnets. Their arrangement in space, position and orientation, allows the creation of an area of convergence of magnetic forces where nanoparticles can be pushed/pulled to. To ensure the reachability of the desired orientations and positions, a 3 DOF robot based on a Remote Centre of Motion (RCM) mechanism was developed. It features three concurrent rotational joints that generate a spherical workspace around the head. The control of the latter is based on kinematic models. A prototype of this platform was realized to validate the actuation process. Both magnetic actuator and robotic manipulator were realized using an additive manufacturing approach. We also designed a virtual human head with a life-size cochlea inside. A laser was mounted on the end effector to track the positioning of the actuator. This permitted to experimentally prove the capacity of the robotic system to reach the desired positions and orientations in accordance with the medical needs. This promising robotic approach, makes it possible to overcome anatomical barriers and steer magnetic nanoparticles to a targeted location in the inner ear and, more precisely, inside the cochlea. © 2022 AGBM

AB  - Long-Term use of dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with reduction in efficacy and disabling dyskinesias. The current medical or surgical treatment modalities are ineffective for atypical parkinsonism syndromes. Hence, there is a need for holistic and cost-effective non-pharmacological interventions that act via multiple mechanisms to improve motor as well as non-motor symptoms among PD patients. Rehabilitation strategies focusing on multiple mechanisms can lead to improvement in certain symptoms among PD patients, which may be refractory to medical and surgical therapy. However, there is scanty literature available on the role of various rehabilitation strategies in patients with atypical parkinsonism patients. Multiple rehabilitation strategies such physiotherapy, aerobic exercises, strength/resistance exercises, treadmill training, cueing, dance and music, speech language therapy, occupational therapy, hydrotherapy, and martial arts have been found to improve motor as well as non-motor symptoms among PD patients. Newer modalities such as virtual-reality-based devices, exergaming, wearable sensors, and robotic prosthetic devices may be exciting future prospects in rehabilitation among patients with PD and atypical parkinsonian syndromes. This narrative review assessed and summarized the current evidence regarding the role of various rehabilitation strategies in PD and atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Furthermore, evidence regarding recent advancements in rehabilitation for patients with parkinsonism was highlighted. Despite the beneficial effect of rehabilitation in PD, there is still scanty literature available from India on rehabilitation strategies among PD patients. Larger prospective randomized control trials from India and other low-and middle-income countries, focusing on various rehabilitation strategies among PD patients, are an unmet need. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

AB  - This paper proposes an adjustable wide-range speed-control method for sensorless IPMSM drive systems from standstill, low-speeds, middle-speeds, and high-speeds in the flux-weakening region. A sensorless method and an online parameter estimation method based on the measurement of current-slope under SVPWM with an extension compensation are proposed. The estimated rotor position, rotor speed, d-q axis inductances, magnetic flux, and torque of the IPMSM are precisely computed by using a current-slope measurement, and then a closed-loop speed control sensorless IPMSM drive system is implemented without requiring any external high-frequency signal injection or a complicated observer. In addition, to achieve a high-performance sensorless IPMSM drive system, the estimated parameters are used for real-time maximum torque per ampere control and flux-weakening control. Finally, the proposed sensorless IPMSM drive system provides a wide operation range from 1 r/min to 3000 r/min with excellent performance in constant-torque regions and flux-weakening regions. A digital signal processor, made by Texas Instrument, type TMS 320F2802, is employed to realize the control algorithm and estimation algorithm. Experimental results show the proposed sensorless IPMSM drive system achieves satisfactory responses, including \pm \,{\mathrm {2.5}}^{\circ } of electrical position estimation errors, good dynamic responses, and good tracking responses.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Neurofeedback training is a closed-loop neuromodulatory technique in which real-time feedback of brain activity and connectivity is provided to the participant for the purpose of volitional neural control. Through practice and reinforcement, such learning has been shown to facilitate measurable changes in brain function and behavior. Objectives: In this review, we examine how neurofeedback, coupled with motor imagery training, has the potential to improve or normalize motor function in neurological diseases such as Parkinson disease and chronic stroke. We will also explore neurofeedback in the context of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), discussing both noninvasive and invasive methods which have been used to power external devices (eg, robot hand orthosis or exoskeleton) in the context of motor neurorehabilitation. Conclusions: The published literature provides mounting high-quality evidence that neurofeedback and BMI control may lead to clinically relevant changes in brain function and behavior. © 2022 International Neuromodulation Society

AB  - Modelling humans' trust in robots is critical during human-robot interaction (HRI) to avoid under- or over-reliance on robots. Currently, it is challenging to calibrate trust in real-time. Consequently, we see limited work on calibrating humans' trust in robots in HRI. In this paper we describe a mathematical model that attempts to emulate the three-layered (initial, situational, learned) framework of trust capable of potentially estimating humans' trust in robots in real-time. We evaluated the trust model in an experimental setup that involved participants playing a trust game on four occasions. We validate the model based on linear regression analysis that showed that the trust perception score (TPS) and interaction session predicted the trust modelled score (TMS) computed by applying the trust model. We also show that TPS and TMS did not change significantly from the second to the fourth session. However, TPS and TMS captured in the last session increased significantly from the first session. The described work is an initial effort to model three layers of humans' trust in robot in a repeated HRI setup and requires further testing and extension to improve its robustness across settings. © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Advanced robotics, high-speed networking, and real-time haptics have opened a myriad of opportunities to extend telesurgery in Metaverse environments. The telesurgery metaverse (TMs) offers high-quality, immersive, and interactive surgical scenarios. Despite the remarkable progress, TMs suffer from operational threats against quantum-adversarial attacks, which can jeopardize the integrity, reliability, and safety of operated patients. The paper presents a novel framework Quant-Meta, that integrates quantum key distribution (QKD) in TM through the BB84 protocol. A framework is presented for TM, where the surgeon communicates via gestures that are communicated securely to the robotic arm present in a metaverse environment. A quantum channel sets up the BB84 key distribution, and the sender and receiver agree to the shared key. Once it is set up, the communication is supported by a 6G-envisioned tactile internet (TI) channel. which assures high reliability. To ensure high precision, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is integrated with the trained model to predict doctor gestures. The framework is analyzed in terms of BB84 protocol design, and quantum channel parameters. The result signifies a high probability of intruder detection and a 19.87 % improvement in channel transmission rate. The quantum bit error rate also likes below 4 %, with a high sifted key rate. The results indicate the potential viability of the framework in practical telesurgical deployments.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In this contribution, order reduction of self-balanced-bicycle-robot (SBBR) controller is proposed by incorporating rank-order-centroid (ROC) based method utilizing grey-wolf-optimizer. The higher-order (HO) SBBR controller system is approximated by minimizing the errors between time-moments (TMs) and Markov-parameters (MPs) of HO SBBR system and desired approximated-model. The minimization of errors are accomplished by framing the weighted objective function utilizing TMs and MPs. The weights are associated with the weighted objective function. These weights are determined by systematic procedure of ROC based method. The main orientation of this proposal is to ascertain the associated weights in a systematic manner exploiting ROC method by providing the appropriate importance to effect-on-steady-state response and effect-on-transient response for SBBR controller based robotic application. The minimization of weighted objective function is done for the determination of unknown coefficients of approximant with the help of grey-wolf-optimizer. The optimization is done by employing matching of first TMs of the HO system and approximated-model ensuring the steady-state-matching. In this approximation, the stability of desired approximant is also ensured with the help of Hurwitz stability criterion. The obtained approximant is compared with already available controller models for SBBR in the literature. The step and impulse along with error and Bode responses are plotted to show the efficacy and productiveness of proposed method. The time-domain-analysis and performance-error-criterion-analysis are also provided in the support of proposed methodology. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Dysphagia, which refers to difficult and/or disordered swallowing, is a common problem associated with various neurological diseases such as stroke, motor neuron diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. Traditionally, dysphagia treatments are either compensatory, which includes modifications of bolus texture or feeding posture, or rehabilitative, which includes behavioral exercises and sensory stimulation. Despite being widely adopted in clinical practice, recent views have challenged the clinical efficacy of these treatments due to the low level of evidence supported by mainly non-controlled studies. As such, with advancements in technology and scientific research methods, recent times have seen a surge in the development of novel dysphagia treatments and an increasing number of robust randomized controlled clinical trials. In this review, we will review the clinical evidence of several newly introduced treatments for dysphagia in the last two decades, including rehabilitative exercises, biofeedback, pharmacological treat-ments, neuromodulation treatments and soft robotics. Despite the recent improvements in the quality of evidence for the efficacy of dysphagia treatments, several critical issues, including heterogeneity in treatment regimens, long-term treatment effects, underlying mechanisms of some neuromodulation treatments, and the effects of these techniques in non-stroke dysphagia, remain to be addressed in future clinical trials. © 2022, Dove Medical Press Ltd.

AB  - Non-progressive conditions that develop in the growing fetus or newborn brain and result in lifelong motor impairments and activity restrictions are collectively referred to as cerebral palsy. In the present review, recent advancements in the treatment of cerebral palsy are discussed. Studies are currently being conducted on high-tech aids such as telemedicine, robotics, virtual reality, telerehabilitation, and exoskeletons. In the current review, we focus on the effectiveness of interventions including neurologic music therapy, aquatic therapy, virtual reality, robotics, electrical stimulation, constraint-induced movement therapy, hippotherapy, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. We also discuss the drugs used for the treatment of spasticity in cerebral palsy, as well as the effects of nutritional intake. Neurologic music therapy alongside physiotherapy leads to positive rehabilitation outcomes, as does treadmill gait training combined with robotics for lower limb improvements. Furthermore, kinesio taping is helpful for positioning the wrist, thumb, and fingers, and for reducing upper limb stiffness. Neurorestorative therapies such as cell therapy, brain-computer interface technology, and transcranial magnetic stimulation may also effectively restore neural networks in a positive direction in cerebral palsy. Finally, rehabilitation along with neurofeedback and biofeedback is considered helpful in patients with this neurological disorder. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - OBJECTIVE Up to 50% of the nearly 800,000 patients who experience a new or recurrent stroke each year in the United States fail to achieve full independence afterward. More effective approaches to enhance motor recovery following stroke are needed. This article reviews the rehabilitative principles and strategies that can be used to maximize post-stroke recovery. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS Evidence dictates that mobilization should not begin prior to 24 hours following stroke, but detailed guidelines beyond this are lacking. Specific classes of potentially detrimental medications should be avoided in the early days poststroke. Patients with stroke who are unable to return home should be referred for evaluation to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Research suggests that a substantial increase in both the dose and intensity of upper and lower extremity exercise is beneficial. A clinical trial supports vagus nerve stimulation as an adjunct to occupational therapy for motor recovery in the upper extremity. The data remain somewhat mixed as to whether robotics, transcranial magnetic stimulation, functional electrical stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation are better than dose-matched traditional exercise. No current drug therapy has been proven to augment exercise poststroke to enhance motor recovery. ESSENTIAL POINTS Neurologists will collaborate with rehabilitation professionals for several months following a patient's stroke. Many questions still remain about the ideal exercise regimen to maximize motor recovery in patients poststroke. The next several years will likely bring a host of new research studies exploring the latest strategies to enhance motor recovery using poststroke exercise. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Introduction: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) mapping has become a critical tool for exploratory studies of the human corticomotor (M1) organization. Here, we propose to gather existing cutting-edge TMS-EMG and TMS-EEG approaches into a combined multi-dimensional TMS mapping that considers local and whole-brain excitability changes as well as state and time-specific changes in cortical activity. We applied this multi-dimensional TMS mapping approach to patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) with Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) ON and OFF. Our goal was to identifying one or several TMS mapping-derived markers that could provide unprecedent new insights onto the mechanisms of DBS in movement disorders. Methods: Six PD patients (1 female, mean age: 62.5 yo [59–65]) implanted with DBS-STN for 1 year, underwent a robotized sulcus-shaped TMS motor mapping to measure changes in muscle-specific corticomotor representations and a movement initiation task to probe state-dependent modulations of corticospinal excitability in the ON (using clinically relevant DBS parameters) and OFF DBS states. Cortical excitability and evoked dynamics of three cortical areas involved in the neural control of voluntary movements (M1, pre-supplementary motor area – preSMA and inferior frontal gyrus – IFG) were then mapped using TMS-EEG coupling in the ON and OFF state. Lastly, we investigated the timing and nature of the STN-to-M1 inputs using a paired pulse DBS-TMS-EEG protocol. Results: In our sample of patients, DBS appeared to induce fast within-area somatotopic re-arrangements of motor finger representations in M1, as revealed by mediolateral shifts of corticomuscle representations. STN-DBS improved reaction times while up-regulating corticospinal excitability, especially during endogenous motor preparation. Evoked dynamics revealed marked increases in inhibitory circuits in the IFG and M1 with DBS ON. Finally, inhibitory conditioning effects of STN single pulses on corticomotor activity were found at timings relevant for the activation of inhibitory GABAergic receptors (4 and 20 ms). Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggest a predominant role of some markers in explaining beneficial DBS effects, such as a context-dependent modulation of corticospinal excitability and the recruitment of distinct inhibitory circuits, involving long-range projections from higher level motor centers and local GABAergic neuronal populations. These combined measures might help to identify discriminative features of DBS mechanisms towards deep clinical phenotyping of DBS effects in Parkinson’s Disease and in other pathological conditions.

AB  - Background: Injuries to the neuromusculoskeletal system often result in weakness and gait impairments. Functional resistance training during walking—where patients walk while a device increases loading on the leg—is an emerging approach to combat these symptoms. However, there are many methods that can be used to resist the patient, which may alter the biomechanics of the training. Thus, all methods may not address patient-specific deficits. Methods: We performed a comprehensive electronic database search to identify articles that acutely (i.e., after a single training session) examined how functional resistance training during walking alters muscle activation, gait biomechanics, and neural plasticity. Only articles that examined these effects during training or following the removal of resistance (i.e., aftereffects) were included. Findings: We found 41 studies that matched these criteria. Most studies (24) used passive devices (e.g., weighted cuffs or resistance bands) while the remainder used robotic devices. Devices varied on if they were wearable (14) or externally tethered, and the type of resistance they applied (i.e., inertial [14], elastic [8], viscous [7], or customized [12]). Notably, these methods provided device-specific changes in muscle activation, biomechanics, and spatiotemporal and kinematic aftereffects. Some evidence suggests this training results in task-specific increases in neural excitability. Interpretation: These findings suggest that careful selection of resistive strategies could help target patient-specific strength deficits and gait impairments. Also, many approaches are low-cost and feasible for clinical or in-home use. The results provide new insights for clinicians on selecting an appropriate functional resistance training strategy to target patient-specific needs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is an increasingly popular research topic due to its extensive potential applications, such as education, healthcare, emergency response, and social interaction. Sign language is a complex and dynamic language comprising hand gestures, facial expressions, and body motions. This high level of variability poses a significant obstacle for SLR tasks, which must accurately identify and respond to numerous gestures. To address these challenges, an end-to-end skeleton-based multi-feature multi-stream multi-level information sharing network (three multi information sharing network (TMS-Net)) is proposed. Specifically, in order to input more rich information to TMS-Net, we use joint feature pair with global features, bone feature pair with local features, and angle feature pair with scale invariance. In terms of network structure, to efficiently extract multiple features from inputs, we build a multi-stream structure and design a multi-level information sharing mechanism based on this structure to ensure the full utilization of skeleton feature information. From the experiment results of the WLASL-2000 dataset (56.4%), AUTSL dataset (96.62%) and MSASL(65.13%), TMS-Net surpass the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with single modality as input. In addition, a SLR-based human–robot interaction (HRI) experiment using our proposed TMS-Net is conducted, which proves the practical performance of the TMS-Net. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Late-life depression (LLD) is one of the most common mental disorders among the older adults. Population aging, social stress, and the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly affected the emotional health of older adults, resulting in a worldwide prevalence of LLD. The clinical phenotypes between LLD and adult depression differ in terms of symptoms, comorbid physical diseases, and coexisting cognitive impairments. Many pathological factors such as the imbalance of neurotransmitters, a decrease in neurotrophic factors, an increase in β-amyloid production, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and changes in the gut microbiota, are allegedly associated with the onset of LLD. However, the exact pathogenic mechanism underlying LLD remains unclear. Traditional selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor therapy results in poor responsiveness and side effects during LLD treatment. Neuromodulation therapies and complementary and integrative therapies have been proven safe and effective for the treatment of LLD. Importantly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, modern digital health intervention technologies, including socially assistive robots and app-based interventions, have proven to be advantageous in providing personal services to patients with LLD.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) stands out among the rapidly developing methods for clinical rehabilitation of patients after cerebral vascular accidents. The method is widely used not only in post-stroke rehabilitation, but also in sports medicine, psychiatry and other fields of medicine. However, there is an unresolved issue related to precise targeting and holding the magnetic field focus on the points of interest in the brain when performing TMS. Unprecise magnetic field focus localization may result in the emergence of side effects during the TMS session. The review provides the existing solutions of these problems, comparison of the commercially available navigation devices for TMS, analysis of their composition and operation algorithms; promising directions of developing hardware for TMS navigation are proposed. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - The use of TMS-EEG coupling as a neuroimaging tool for the functional exploration of the human brain recently gained strong interest. If this tool directly inherits the fine temporal resolution from EEG, its spatial counterpart remains unknown. In this study, we explored the spatial resolution of TMS-EEG coupling by evaluating the minimal distance between two stimulated cortical sites that would significantly evoke different response dynamics. TMS evoked responses were mapped on the sensorimotor region in twenty participants. The stimulation grid was composed of nine targets separated between 10 and 15 mm on average. The dynamical signatures of TMS evoked activity were extracted and compared between sites using both local and remote linear regression scores and spatial generalized mixed models. We found a significant effect of the distance between stimulated sites on their dynamical signatures, neighboring sites showing differentiable response dynamics. Besides, common dynamical signatures were also found between sites up to 25-30 mm from each other. This overlap in dynamical properties decreased with distance and was stronger between sites within the same Brodmann area. Our results suggest that the spatial resolution of TMS-EEG coupling might be at least as high as 10 mm. Furthermore, our results reveal an anisotropic spatial resolution that was higher across than within the same Brodmann areas, in accordance with the TMS induced E-field modeling. Common cytoarchitectonic leading to shared dynamical properties within the same Brodmann area could also explain this anisotropy. Overall, these findings suggest that TMS-EEG benefits from the spatial resolution of TMS, which makes it an accurate technique for meso-scale brain mapping. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) encompass a variety of neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized by progressive deterioration of walking ability and a high risk for long-term disability. The management of problems associated with HSP, such as stiffness, deformity, muscle contractures, and cramping, requires strict adherence to recommended physiotherapy activity regimes. The aim of this paper is to conduct a critical narrative review of the available evidence focusing exclusively to the therapeutic advantages associated with various forms of physical therapy (PT) in the context of HSP, emphasizing the specific benefit of every distinct approach in relation to muscle relaxation, muscle strength, spasticity reduction, improvement of weakness, enhancement of balance, posture, walking ability, and overall quality of life. Methods: To conduct a literature review, the databases PubMed, Scopus, and DOAJ (last access in June 2023) were searched. Results: The PubMed search returned a total of 230 articles, Scopus returned 218, and DOAJ returned no results. After screening, the final list included 7 papers on PT treatment for HSP patients. Conclusion: Electrostimulation, magnetotherapy, hydrotherapy, PT, robot-assisted gait training, and balance rehabilitation have the potential to increase lower extremity strength and decrease spasticity in HSP patients.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a non-invasive therapeutic procedure in which specific cortical brain regions are stimulated in order to disrupt abnormal neural behaviour. This procedure requires the annotation of a number of cortical point targets which is often performed by a human expert. Nevertheless, there is a large degree of variability between experts that cannot be described readily using the existing zero-mean uni-modal error model common in computer-assisted interventions. This is due to the error between experts arising from a difference of type rather than a difference of degree, that is, experts are not necessarily picking the same point with some error, but are picking fundamentally different points. In order to model these types of localisation errors, this paper proposes a simple probabilistic model that uses the agreement between annotations as a basis, not requiring a ground-truth annotation to be strictly known. This work will allow for the localisation error in transcranial magnetic stimulation to be better described which may spur further developments in clinical training as well as machine learning for cortical point localisation.  © 2022 SPIE.

AB  - Purpose: To explore the difference in rehabilitation effect between soft robot gloves and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in patients with severe upper limb motor dysfunction after a stroke. Methods: A total of 69 post-stroke patients with severe upper limb dysfunction were randomly assigned to a repetitive transcranial magnetic group, a soft robotic glove group, and a conventional treatment group. The primary outcomes were the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment (FMA-UE) and the Modified Barthel Index (MBI). The secondary endpoints were the amplitude surface electromyogram of the extensor wrist muscle (sEMG) and the cerebral hemispheric resting motor threshold (RMT). Results: The change of FMA-UE score in the soft robotic glove group was significantly better than that in the conventional treatment group (median difference: 2 points; 95% confidence interval [1, 3]; P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference compared with the repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation group (median difference: 0 points; 95% confidence interval [−1, 2]; P [0.547] > 0.05). There was no significant difference in the change of MBI score between the soft robotic glove group and the conventional treatment and repetitive transcranial magnetic treatment groups [F = 2.458, P [0.093] > 0.05]. There was no significant difference in the change of sEMG score between the soft robotic glove group and the conventional treatment and repetitive transcranial magnetic treatment groups [H = 0.042, P [0.980] > 0.05]. Additionally, the change of RMT score in the soft robotic glove group was significantly inferior to that in the repetitive transcranial magnetic treatment group [difference: −1.09; 95% confidence interval [−2.048, 0.048]; P < 0.05], but there was no significant difference compared with the conventional treatment group [difference: 0.31 points; 95% confidence interval [−0.879, 0.358]; P [0.495] > 0.05]. Conclusion: For patients with severe dyskinesia after a stroke, soft robotic gloves are as effective as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and may be a good choice for home rehabilitation. In addition, conventional treatment combined with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or a soft robotic glove produced better rehabilitation outcomes than conventional treatment alone.

AB  - Background Approximately 40% of patients treated for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) do not respond to standard and second-line augmentation treatments leading to the exploration of alternate biological treatments. Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) is a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation inducing more rapid and longer-lasting effects on synaptic plasticity than the latter. To the best of our knowledge, only one recent study and a case report investigated the effect of cTBS at the supplementary motor area (SMA) in OCD. Objective This study aimed to examine the effect of accelerated robotized neuronavigated cTBS over SMA in patients with OCD. Methods A total of 32 patients with OCD were enrolled and randomized into active and sham cTBS groups. For active cTBS stimulation, an accelerated protocol was used. Bursts of three stimuli at 50 Hz, at 80% of MT, repeated at 5 Hz were used. Daily 2 sessions of 900 pulses each, for a total of 30 sessions over 3 wk (weekly 10 sessions), were given. Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Rating Scale (YBOCS), Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) were administered at baseline and at end of weeks 3 and 8. Results A total of 26 patients completed the study. Active cTBS group showed significant group × time effect in YBOCS obsession (P < .001, η2 = 0.288), compulsion (P = .004, η2 = 0.207), YBOCS total (P < .001, η2 = 0.288), CGI-S (P = .010, η2 = 0.248), CGI-C (P = .010, η2 = 0.248), HAM-D (P = .014, η2 = 0.224) than sham cTBS group. Conclusions Findings from our study suggest that adjunctive accelerated cTBS significantly improves psychopathology, severity of illness, and depression among patients with OCD. Future studies with larger sample sizes will add to our knowledge.  © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, debilitating disease characterised by demyelination of the nerves of the central nervous system that results in patients progressively losing the ability to perform daily tasks. As there is no cure for this disease, rehabilitation therapy is an important aspect of care; assisting patients to regain or retain function and improve their physical, mental and social wellbeing. At present there is no current consistent model of care for MS, likely due to the variable symptom presentation. Various forms of rehabilitation therapy are available, and these include physical rehabilitation methods, such as balance and gait therapy, speech and respiration rehabilitation, and occupational therapy. Contrary to previous understanding, exercise-based therapies have shown various benefits for patients with MS, and in addition to improving MS-related physical symptoms, have been shown to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and can improve cognitive function. Cognition rehabilitation therapy specifically focuses on behavioural tasks and is divided into two main forms: compensatory rehabilitation, which offers cognitive functioning benefits, and restorative rehabilitation, which offers memory benefits. Excitation therapies include cranial stimulation and other stimulation rehabilitation methods such as focal muscle vibration therapy and these non-invasive techniques may improve patient's physical ability. Additionally, more novel rehabilitation methods include robot-assisted gait therapy and telerehabilitation, both of which are expected to play progressively more prominent roles in the future of rehabilitation therapy. The structure of the care team has been found to impact patient outcomes, and both in- and out-patient care settings have been found to be beneficial, dependant on the patient's circumstances, with certain patients better suited to a particular setting. While a single point of care is recommended for patients, a multidisciplinary care team and regular reassessment is recommended to manage changing symptoms and ensure continuity of care. The importance of the critical components of rehabilitation have been identified, and these are of vital importance in achieving beneficial outcomes. These components include the patients’ participation in the treatment, goal setting with a multidisciplinary care team, a guiding-light purpose for the patient, which focusses on recognizing their personal potential and obtaining improvements through a tailored plan. The final critical component of rehabilitation is the results measurement, which highlights the need for a quantifiable reduction in impairment and improvement in activity and participation. Overall, a lack of standardisation in outcome measurements makes comparison challenging. This is particularly important when comparing standard methods of care with more novel rehabilitation techniques. However, within the broad area of rehabilitation therapies, it is clear that patients with MS can benefit from rehabilitation practices; physically, mentally and socially. © 2022

AB  - In this proposal, order diminution of self-balanced linear-momentum based bicycle-robot (LMBR) controller is proposed with the help of time-moments (TMs) and Markov-parameters (MPs) of higher-order (HO) LMBR controller and its desired reduced-order (RO) model by utilizing jaya algorithm. Firstly, the TMs and MPs of HO LMBR controller and its RO model are obtained. The TMs of HO LMBR controller and RO model are exploited for steady state matching. The MPs are utilized to construct the objective function which is weighted summation of errors in between MPs of HO LMBR controller and RO model. The framed objective function is minimized with the help of jaya algorithm. The minimization of errors between MPs of HO LMBR controller and RO model are done for ascertainment of unknown coefficients of desired RO model. The proposed RO model for HO LMBR controller is compared with the model obtained by exploiting other order reduction methods available in the literature.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Neurorecovery from locomotor training is well established in human spinal cord injury (SCI). However, neurorecovery resulting from combined interventions has not been widely studied. In this randomized clinical trial, we established the tibialis anterior (TA) flexion reflex modulation pattern when transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex was paired with transcutaneous spinal cord (transspinal) stimulation over the thoracolumbar region during assisted step training. Single pulses of TMS were delivered either before (TMS-transspinal) or after (transspinal-TMS) transspinal stimulation during the stance phase of the less impaired leg. Eight individuals with chronic incomplete or complete SCI received at least 20 sessions of paired stimulation during assisted step training. Each session consisted of 240 paired stimuli delivered over 10-min blocks for 1 h during robotic-assisted step training with the Lokomat6 Pro®. Body weight support, leg guidance force and treadmill speed were adjusted based on each participant’s ability to step without knee buckling or toe dragging. Both the early and late TA flexion reflex remained unaltered after TMS-transspinal and locomotor training. In contrast, the early and late TA flexion reflexes were significantly depressed during stepping after transspinal-TMS and locomotor training. Reflex changes occurred at similar slopes and intercepts before and after training. Our findings support that targeted brain and spinal cord stimulation coupled with locomotor training reorganizes the function of flexion reflex pathways, which are a part of locomotor networks, in humans with varying levels of sensorimotor function after SCI.

AB  - In recent years, the neural control mechanisms of the arms and legs during human bipedal walking have been clarified. Rhythmic leg stepping leads to suppression of monosynaptic reflex excitability in forearm muscles. However, it is unknown whether and how corticospinal excitability of the forearm muscle is modulated during leg stepping. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the excitability of the corticospinal tract in the forearm muscle during passive and voluntary stepping. To compare the neural effects on corticospinal excitability to those on monosynaptic reflex excitability, the present study also assessed the excitability of the H-reflex in the forearm muscle during both types of stepping. A robotic gait orthosis was used to produce leg stepping movements similar to those of normal walking. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and H-reflexes were evoked in the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle during passive and voluntary stepping. The results showed that FCR MEP amplitudes were significantly enhanced during the mid-stance and terminal-swing phases of voluntary stepping, while there was no significant difference between the phases during passive stepping. Conversely, the FCR H-reflex was suppressed during both voluntary and passive stepping, compared to the standing condition. The present results demonstrated that voluntary commands to leg muscles, combined with somatosensory inputs, may facilitate corticospinal excitability in the forearm muscle, and that somatosensory inputs during walking play a major role in monosynaptic reflex suppression in forearm muscle. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Robot-assisted rehabilitation (RAR) and non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) are interventions that, both individually and combined, can significantly enhance motor performance after spinal cord injury (SCI). We sought to determine whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with active transvertebral direct current stimulation (tvDCS) (namely, NIBS) in association with RAR (RAR + NIBS) improves lower extremity motor function more than RAR alone in subjects with motor incomplete SCI (iSCI). Fifteen adults with iSCI received one daily session of RAR+NIBS in the early afternoon, six sessions weekly, for eight consecutive weeks. Outcome measures included the 6 min walk test (6MWT), the 10 m walk test (10MWT), the timed up and go (TUG) to test mobility and balance, the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI II), the Functional Independence Measure-Locomotion (FIM-L), the manual muscle testing for lower extremity motor score (LEMS), the modified Ashworth scale for lower limbs (MAS), and the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. The data of these subjects were compared with those of 20 individuals matched for clinical and demographic features who previously received the same amount or RAR without NIBS (RAR − NIBS). All patients completed the trial, and none reported any side effects either during or following the training. The 10MWT improved in both groups, but the increase was significantly greater following RAR + NIBS than RAR − NIBS. The same occurred for the FIM-L, LEMS, and WISCI II. No significant differences were appreciable concerning the 6MWT and TUG. Conversely, RAR − NIBS outperformed RAR + NIBS regarding the MAS and VAS. Pairing tvDCS with rTMS during RAR can improve lower extremity motor function more than RAR alone can do. Future research with a larger sample size is recommended to determine longer-term effects on motor function and activities of daily living. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - A 10-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex has been shown to increase dopaminergic activity in the dorsal striatum, a region strongly implicated in reinforcement learning. However, the behavioural influence of this effect remains largely unknown. We tested the causal effects of 10-Hz stimulation on behavioural and computational characteristics of reinforcement learning. A total of 40 healthy individuals were randomized into active and sham (placebo) stimulation groups. Each participant underwent one stimulation session (1500 pulses) in which stimulation was applied over the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex using a robotic arm. Participants then completed a reinforcement learning task sensitive to striatal dopamine functioning. Participants' choices were modelled using a reinforcement learning model (Q-learning) that calculates separate learning rates associated with positive and negative reward prediction errors. Subjects receiving active stimulation exhibited increased reward rate (number of correct responses per second of task activity) compared with those in sham. Computationally, although no group differences were observed, the active group displayed a higher learning rate for correct trials (αG) compared with incorrect trials (αL). Finally, when tested with novel pairs of stimuli, the active group displayed extremely fast reaction times, and a trend towards a higher reward rate. This study provided specific behavioural and computational accounts of altered striatal-mediated behaviour, particularly response vigour, induced by a proposed increase of dopamine activity by 10-Hz stimulation to the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. Together, these findings bolster the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to target neurocognitive disturbances attributed to the dysregulation of dopaminergic-striatal circuits. © 2022 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Gallium-based liquid metals (LMs) are a group of metal materials that are in liquid state at room temperature. Their unique physiochemical properties such as fluidity, conductivity, and interfacial properties with other materials have presented great potentials and wide applications. Specifically, the interactions between gallium-based LMs and some common but important transition metals (TMs) have not only enabled a series of intriguing phenomena but also provided valuable strategies or functional materials in soft robotics, devices, flexible electronics, addictive manufacturing, biomedical engineering and therapies, and other fields. The chemical mechanisms including the galvanic corrosion, infiltration, intermetallic compound formation should play vital roles within these interactions. Hereby the combining the LMs and TMs by alloying or physically mixing may offer a platform to develop novel and multifunctional materials system. To acquire a comprehensive understanding of those interactions as well as to inspire the researches for multifunctional materials design and applications, this article reviews the researches on the combination of LMs and TMs, discusses the characteristics, the mechanisms, and their applications especially in electronics, smart materials, and biomedicine. The main challenges and future research outlook are also discussed. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Trial-anderror motor adaptation has been linked to somatosensory plasticity and shifts in proprioception (limb position sense). The role of sensory processing in motor skill learning is less understood. Unlike adaptation, skill learning involves the acquisition of new movement patterns in the absence of perturbation, with performance limited by the speed-accuracy trade-off. We investigated somatosensory changes during motor skill learning at the behavioral and neurophysiological levels. Twenty-eight healthy young adults practiced a maze-tracing task, guiding a robotic manipulandum through an irregular twodimensional track featuring several abrupt turns. Practice occurred on days 1 and 2. Skill was assessed before practice on day 1 and again on day 3, with learning indicated by a shift in the speed-accuracy function between these assessments. Proprioceptive function was quantified with a passive two-alternative forced-choice task. In a subset of 15 participants, we measured short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) to index somatosensory projections to motor cortex. We found that motor practice enhanced the speed-accuracy skill function (F4.108= 32.15, P < 0.001) and was associated with improved proprioceptive sensitivity at retention (t22= 24.75, P = 0.0031). Furthermore, SAI increased after training (F1.14= 5.41, P = 0.036). Interestingly, individuals with larger increases in SAI, reflecting enhanced somatosensory afference to motor cortex, demonstrated larger improvements in motor skill learning. These findings suggest that SAI may be an important functional mechanism for some aspect of motor skill learning. Further research is needed to test what parameters (task complexity, practice time, etc.) are specifically linked to somatosensory function. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Somatosensory processing has been implicated in motor adaptation, where performance recovers from a perturbation such as a force field. We investigated somatosensory function during motor skill learning, where a new motor pattern is acquired in the absence of perturbation. After skill practice, we found changes in proprioception and short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), signifying somatosensory change at both the behavioral and neurophysiological levels. SAI may be an important functional mechanism by which individuals learn motor skills. © 2020 American Physiological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a procedure increasingly used to treat patients with central neuropathic pain, but its efficacy is still under debate. Patients with medically refractory chronic central neuropathic pain were included in 2 randomized phases (active/sham), separated by a wash-out period of 8 weeks. Each phase consisted of 4 consecutive rTMS sessions and a final evaluation session, all separated from one another by 3 weeks. High-frequency (20 Hz) rTMS was delivered over the primary motor cortex (M1) contralateral to the patient's pain using a neuronavigated robotic system. Patients and clinicians assessing outcomes were blinded to treatment allocation during the trial. The primary outcome measured the percentage of pain relief (%R) from baseline. Secondary outcomes were VAS score, Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory, analgesic drug consumption, and quality of life (EQ-5D). Thirty-six patients performed the entire study with no adverse effects. The analgesic effect for the main criterion (%R) was significantly higher in the active (33.8% confidence interval [CI]: [23.88-43.74]) than in the sham phase (13.02% CI: [6.64-19.76]). This was also the case for the secondary outcome VAS (-19.34% CI: [14.31-25.27] vs -4.83% CI: [1.96-8.18]). No difference was observed for quality of life or analgesic drug consumption. Seventeen patients (47%) were identified as responders, but no significant interaction was found between clinical and technical factors considered here and the analgesic response. These results provide strong evidence that 3 weeks spaced high-frequency rTMS of M1 results in a sustained analgesic effect and support the clinical interest of this stimulation paradigm to treat refractory chronic pain. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - For achieving motor recovery in individuals with sensorimotor deficits, augmented activation of the appropriate sensorimotor system, and facilitated induction of neural plasticity are essential. An emerging procedure that combines peripheral nerve stimulation and its associative stimulation with central brain stimulation is known to enhance the excitability of the motor cortex. In order to effectively apply this paired stimulation technique, timing between central and peripheral stimuli must be individually adjusted. There is a small range of effective timings between two stimuli, or the inter-stimulus interval window (ISI-W). Properties of ISI-W from neuromodulation in response to mechanical stimulation (Mstim) of muscles have been understudied because of the absence of a versatile and reliable mechanical stimulator. This paper adopted a combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and Mstim by using a high-precision robotic mechanical stimulator. A pneumatically operated robotic tendon tapping device was applied. A low-friction linear cylinder achieved high stimulation precision in time and low electromagnetic artifacts in physiological measurements. This paper describes a procedure to effectively estimate an individual ISI-W from the transiently enhanced motor evoked potential (MEP) with a reduced number of paired Mstim and sub-threshold TMS trials by applying statistical sampling and regression technique. This paper applied a total of four parametric and non-parametric statistical regression methods for ISI-W estimation. The developed procedure helps to reduce time for individually adjusting effective ISI, reducing physical burden on the subject. © 2020 Frontiers Media S.A.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Robotic transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive and safe tool that produces cortical motor maps using neuronavigational and neuroanatomical images. Motor maps are individualized representations of the primary motor cortex (M1) topography that may reflect developmental and interventional plasticity. Results of TMS motor map reliability testing have been variable, and robotic measures are undefined. We aimed to determine the short- and long-term reliability of robotic TMS motor maps. Twenty healthy participants underwent motor mapping at baseline, 24 h, and 4 wk. A 12 × 12 grid (7-mm spacing) was placed over the left M1, centered over the hand knob area. Four suprathreshold stimulations were delivered at each grid point. First dorsal interosseous (FDI) motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were analyzed offline to generate map characteristics of area, volume, center of gravity (COG), and hotspot magnitude. Subsets of each outcome corresponding to 75%, 50%, and 25% of each map were determined. Reliability measures including intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), minimal detectable change (MDC), and standard error of measure (SEM) were calculated. Map volume, COG, and hotspot magnitude were the most reliable measures (good-to-excellent) over both short- and long-term sessions. Map area reliability was poor-to-moderate for short- and long-term sessions. Smaller map percentile subsets showed decreased variability but only minimal improvements in reliability. MDC for most outcomes was >50%. Procedures were well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Robotic TMS motor mapping is relatively reliable over time, but careful consideration of specific outcomes is required for this method to interrogate plasticity in the human motor system. © 2021 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - The central nervous system (CNS) controls and coordinates functions of the human body and mind. Damage to the CNS causes several disorders such as cervical spon-dylosis, stroke, amongst others. These disorders deprive the abilities of a person needed for daily life. Rehabilitation is one of the key components in recovery of these abilities after CNS damage and Well-established and coordinated multidisciplinary efforts by special-ized rehabilitation services are needed. However, such services are limited and inadequate in many developing countries. Also, effective rehabilitation requires the involvement of highly trained professionals. Shortage of such experts is also a serious problem in low to middle level income countries. Many individuals with disabilities depend on other people for daily activities. Therefore, researchers have developed many automated rehabilitation systems based on technology to address the lacuna of health care professionals who are trained to assist patients with disabilities. Such systems offer a number of advantages over conventional methods, including a standardized training environment and the ability to increase therapy intensity and dose, while reducing the physical burden on therapists. This paper provides a review of literatures on automated rehabilitation techniques developed for patients with CNS disorders. The literature reviewed in this paper suggests that for successful development of automated rehabilitation, a knowledge about the physiological basis of the recovery of function, employed is essential. A spirit of cooperation between physicians, health care professionals such as physiotherapists, clinical neuro rehabilitation scientists and information technology specialists is also necessary. © 2021 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - Background: While the facilitatory and inhibitory effects of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) and continuous TBS (cTBS) protocols have been well documented on motor physiology, the action of TBS protocols on prefrontal functioning remain unclear. Here we asked whether iTBS or cTBS can differentially modulate reward-related signaling in the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC). Methods: Across 2 experiments, we used a robot-assisted transcranial magnetic stimulation system, combined with electroencephalogram recordings, to investigate the aftereffects of prefrontal iTBS and cTBS on the reward positivity, an electrophysiological signal believed to index sensitivity of the aMCC to rewards. Twenty adults (age, 18–28 years) participated in experiment 1 in which we used a scalp landmark for TBS targeting, and 14 adults (age, 18–28 years) participated in experiment 2, in which we aimed to increase TBS effectiveness by utilizing cortical thickness maps to select individualized dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex targets. Results: We demonstrated that prefrontal iTBS suppressed reward-related signaling in the aMCC (reduction in reward positivity) and caused a decrease in postfeedback switch choices. cTBS displayed no effect. We replicated and strengthened this effect on the reward positivity by targeting dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex regions displaying maximal cortical thickness. Conclusions: While these results are inconsistent with reported TBS effects on motor cortex, the present findings offer a novel transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting approach and normative insights into the magnitude and time course of TBS-induced changes in aMCC excitability. By modulating how the aMCC links value to goal-directed behavior, this research opens an exciting new era of investigative possibilities in the understanding of aMCC function and treatment of aMCC dysfunction. © 2020 Society of Biological Psychiatry

AB  - Purpose: Tumor treating fields (TTFields) is a novel antimitotic treatment that was first proven effective for glioblastoma multiforme, now with trials for several extracranial indications underway. Several studies focused on concurrent TTFields therapy with radiation in the same time period, but were not given simultaneously. This study evaluates the targeting accuracy of simultaneous radiation therapy while TTFields arrays are in place and powered on, ensuring that radiation does not interfere with TTFields and TTFields does not interfere with radiation. This is one of several options to enable TTFields to begin several weeks sooner, and opens potential for synergistic effects of combined therapy. Methods: TTFields arrays were attached to a warm saline water bath and salt was added until the TTFields generator reached the maximal 2000 mA peak-to-peak current. A ball cube phantom containing 2 orthogonal films surrounded by fiducials was placed in the water phantom, CT scanned, and a radiation treatment plan with 58 isocentric beams was created using a 3 cm circular collimator. Fiducial tracking was used to deliver radiation, the films were scanned, and end-to-end targeting error was measured with vendor-supplied software. In addition, radiation effects on electric fields generated by the TTFields system were assessed by examining logfiles generated from the field generator. Results: With TTFields arrays in place and powered on, the robotic radiosurgery system achieved a final targeting result of 0.47 mm, which was well within the submillimeter specification. No discernible effects on TTFields current output beyond 0.3% were observed in the logfiles when the radiation beam pulsed on and off. Conclusion: A robotic radiosurgery system was used to verify that radiation targeting was not adversely affected when the TTFields arrays were in place and the TTFields delivery device was powered on. In addition, this study verified that radiation delivered simultaneously with TTFields did not interfere with the generation of the electric fields. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - It is likely that when using an artificially augmented hand with six fingers, the natural five plus a robotic one, corticospinal motor synergies controlling grasping actions might be different. However, no direct neurophysiological evidence for this reasonable assumption is available yet. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex to directly address this issue during motor imagery of objects’ grasping actions performed with or without the Soft Sixth Finger (SSF). The SSF is a wearable robotic additional thumb patented for helping patients with hand paresis and inherent loss of thumb opposition abilities. To this aim, we capitalized from the solid notion that neural circuits and mechanisms underlying motor imagery overlap those of physiological voluntary actions. After a few minutes of training, healthy humans wearing the SSF rapidly reshaped the pattern of corticospinal outputs towards forearm and hand muscles governing imagined grasping actions of different objects, suggesting the possibility that the extra finger might rapidly be encoded into the user’s body schema, which is integral part of the frontal-parietal grasping network. Such neural signatures might explain how the motor system of human beings is open to very quickly welcoming emerging augmentative bioartificial corticospinal grasping strategies. Such an ability might represent the functional substrate of a final common pathway the brain might count on towards new interactions with the surrounding objects within the peripersonal space. Findings provide a neurophysiological framework for implementing augmentative robotic tools in humans and for the exploitation of the SSF in conceptually new rehabilitation settings. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Cognition affects poststroke recovery, but meta-analyses of cognition have not yet provided a comparison of observational and intervention evidence. Objective: To describe the trajectory of poststroke cognition and the factors that moderate it across intervention and observational cohorts. Methods: Six databases were searched up to January 2020. Studies describing quantitative changes in cognition in adults poststroke were included. Interventions were classified into pharmacological, therapist-led, nonroutine/alternative, and usual care. Summary estimates were compared via hierarchical mixed-effects models. Age, recovery stage, stroke etiology, cognitive domain targeted in studies, and intervention types were investigated as moderators of cognition. Recovery stage and intervention were further analyzed in a multiplicative metaregression model. Results: A total of 43 intervention trials and 79 observation cohorts involving 28 222 stroke participants were included. Heterogeneity was significant (τ2 = 0.09; CI = 0.01-0.21, P <.001) with no evidence of publication bias. Cognitive recovery was greater in intervention trials (g = 0.47; CI = 0.37-0.58) than observational cohorts (g = 0.28; CI = 0.20-0.36) across all moderators analyzed. Nonroutine/alternative and pharmacological trials achieved the best overall results (g = 0.57, CI = 0.42-0.73, and g = 0.52, CI = 0.30-0.74, respectively), followed by therapist-led (g = 0.46; CI = 0.17-0.74), and usual care (g = 0.28; CI = 0.11-0.45) interventions. Medium recovery effects (ie, g ≥ 0.5) were observed in examining first-ever stroke, executive function, visuo-perceptual, consciousness, and psychomotor skills, 61 to 180 days poststroke, in participants aged 65 to 70 years. Conclusion: Cognitive recovery is possible using different controlled interventions in all recovery stages, with smaller benefits ≥2 years poststroke. Longer-term studies are needed to determine the role of nonroutine/alternative therapies and the association between cognitive recovery and performance in everyday activities. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Objective: To study motor cortex plasticity after a period of training with a new prototype of bidirectional hand prosthesis in three left trans-radial amputees, correlating these changes with the modification of Phantom Limb Pain (PLP) in the same period. Methods: Each subject underwent a brain motor mapping with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and PLP evaluation with questionnaires during a six-month training with a prototype of bidirectional hand prosthesis. Results: The baseline motor maps showed in all three amputees a smaller area of muscles representation of the amputated side compared to the intact limb. After training, there was a partial reversal of the baseline asymmetry. The two subjects affected by PLP experienced a statistically significant reduction of pain. Conclusions: Two apparently opposite findings, the invasion of the “deafferented” cortex by neighbouring areas and the “persistence” of neural structures after amputation, could vary according to different target used for measurement. Our results do not support a correlation between PLP and motor cortical changes. Significance: The selection of the target and of the task is essential for studies investigating motor brain plasticity. This study boosts against a direct and unique role of motor cortical changes on PLP genesis. © 2020

AB  - Background: Non-invasive brain stimulation is being increasingly used to interrogate neurophysiology and modulate brain function. Despite the high scientific and therapeutic potential of non-invasive brain stimulation, experience in the developing brain has been limited. Objective: To determine the safety and tolerability of non-invasive neurostimulation in children across diverse modalities of stimulation and pediatric populations. Methods: A non-invasive brain stimulation program was established in 2008 at our pediatric, academic institution. Multi-disciplinary neurophysiological studies included single- and paired-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) methods. Motor mapping employed robotic TMS. Interventional trials included repetitive TMS (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Standardized safety and tolerability measures were completed prospectively by all participants. Results: Over 10 years, 384 children underwent brain stimulation (median 13 years, range 0.8–18.0). Populations included typical development (n = .118), perinatal stroke/cerebral palsy (n = .101), mild traumatic brain injury (n = .121) neuropsychiatric disorders (n = .37), and other (n = .7). No serious adverse events occurred. Drop-outs were rare (<1%). No seizures were reported despite >100 participants having brain injuries and/or epilepsy. Tolerability between single and paired-pulse TMS (542340 stimulations) and rTMS (3.0 million stimulations) was comparable and favourable. TMS-related headache was more common in perinatal stroke (40%) than healthy participants (13%) but was mild and self-limiting. Tolerability improved over time with side-effect frequency decreasing by >50%. Robotic TMS motor mapping was well-tolerated though neck pain was more common than with manual TMS (33% vs 3%). Across 612 tDCS sessions including 92 children, tolerability was favourable with mild itching/tingling reported in 37%. Conclusions: Standard non-invasive brain stimulation paradigms are safe and well-tolerated in children and should be considered minimal risk. Advancement of applications in the developing brain are warranted. A new and improved pediatric NIBS safety and tolerability form is included. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi-DBS) is an effective treatment for primary dystonia; however, its therapeutic mechanism is poorly understood. Because improvement is gradual, GPi-DBS treatment likely involves short- and long-term mechanisms. Abnormal plasticity resulting in somatotopic reorganization is involved in the development of dystonia and has been proposed as a possible mechanism for this gradual improvement, yet it has not been directly investigated. We hypothesized that GPi-DBS will lead to progressive changes in the cortical representations (motor maps) of upper limb muscles. Neuronavigated robotic transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to map the cortical representation of five upper limb muscles in six healthy controls and a 45-yr-old female cervical dystonia patient before (Pre) and at four time points (Post5 to Post314), 5 to 314 days after GPi-DBS. Motor map area and volume decreased in all muscles following GPi-DBS, while changes in overlap and center of gravity distance between muscles were variable. Despite these motor map changes, only dystonic tremor improved after a year of DBS; neck position worsened slightly. These preliminary findings suggest that GPi-DBS may reduce the cortical representation and excitability of upper limb muscles in dystonia and that these changes can occur without clinical improvement. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Neuronavigated robotic transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to investigate changes in upper limb muscle representation in a cervical dystonia patient before and at four time points up to 314 days after globus pallidus pars interna deep brain stimulation (GPi-DBS). GPi-DBS altered excitability and motor cortical representation of upper limb muscles; however, these changes were not associated with clinical improvement. © 2020 the American Physiological Society

AB  - There is no consensus about the definition or most effective treatment for neglect syndrome. The aim of this review was therefore to evaluate the results of trials that investigated different treatment methods for neglect syndrome. A systematic literature search in PubMed and Web of Science databases was performed to identify studies that investigated the effects of neglect therapies. Authors followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Studies were selected by two assayers, and disagreement was resolved by a third reviewer. The literature search identified 202 articles: 19 met the inclusion criteria and were included for data extraction. Thirty-five different kinds of assessments were used in these studies, and 17 treatment methods were applied. Successful treatments were reported at least in some parts of the assessments in 12 studies: mirror therapy (in two trials), transcranial magnetic stimulation, street crossing test in virtual reality, smooth pursuit eye movement training, saccadic eye movement therapy, direct current stimulation, eye patching therapy, prism adaptation treatment, socially assistive pet-type therapeutic robot (PARO), Kinesiological Instrument for Normal and Altered Reaching Movement robotic device therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and optokinetic stimulation (the last two methods in the same trial). No success was shown in seven trials, which contained not only single treatments but combined ones also. Authors concluded that there are no convincing results for or against any of the different therapies used for neglect syndrome. The quality of the trials is questionable, and the numbers of included patients are small in the trials.  Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) motor mapping can characterize the neurophysiology of the motor system. Limitations including human error and the challenges of pediatric populations may be overcome by emerging robotic systems. We aimed to show that neuronavigated robotic motor mapping in adolescents could efficiently produce discrete maps of individual upper extremity muscles, the characteristics of which would correlate with motor behavior. Methods: Typically developing adolescents (TDA) underwent neuronavigated robotic TMS mapping of bilateral motor cortex. Representative maps of first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor pollicis brevis (APB), and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles in each hand were created. Map features including area (primary), volume, and center of gravity were analyzed across different excitability regions (R100%, R75%, R50%, R25%). Correlations between map metrics and validated tests of hand motor function (Purdue Pegboard Test as primary) were explored. Results: Twenty-four right-handed participants (range 12–18 years, median 15.5 years, 52% female) completed bilateral mapping and motor assessments with no serious adverse events or dropouts. Gender and age were associated with hand function and motor map characteristics. Full motor maps (R100%) for FDI did not correlate with motor function in either hand. Smaller excitability subset regions demonstrated reduced variance and dose-dependent correlations between primary map variables and motor function in the dominant hemisphere. Conclusions: Hand function in TDA correlates with smaller subset excitability regions of robotic TMS motor map outcomes. Refined motor maps may have less variance and greater potential to quantify interventional neuroplasticity. Robotic TMS mapping is safe and feasible in adolescents. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Given the limited healthcare resources in low and middle income countries (LMICs), effective rehabilitation strategies that can be realistically adopted in such settings are required. Objective: A systematic review of literature was conducted to identify pragmatic solutions and outcomes capable of enhancing stroke recovery and quality of life of stroke survivors for low-and middle-income countries. Methods: PubMed, HINARI, and Directory of Open Access Journals databases were searched for published Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) till November 2018. Only completed trials published in English with non-pharmacological interventions on adult stroke survivors were included in the review while published protocols, pilot studies and feasibility analysis of trials were excluded. Obtained data were synthesized thematically and descriptively analyzed. Results: One thousand nine hundred and ninety six studies were identified while 347 (65.22% high quality) RCTs were found to be eligible for the review. The most commonly assessed variables (and outcome measure utility) were activities of daily living [75.79% of the studies, with Barthel Index (37.02%)], motor function [66.57%; with Fugl Meyer scale (71.88%)], and gait [31.12%; with 6 min walk test (38.67%)]. Majority of the innovatively high technology interventions such as robot therapy (95.24%), virtual reality (94.44%), transcranial direct current stimulation (78.95%), transcranial magnetic stimulation (88.0%) and functional electrical stimulation (85.00%) were conducted in high income countries. Several traditional and low-cost interventions such as constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), resistant and aerobic exercises (R&AE), task oriented therapy (TOT), body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) were reported to significantly contribute to the recovery of motor function, activity, participation, and improvement of quality of life after stroke. © 2020 Ekechukwu, Olowoyo, Nwankwo, Olaleye, Ogbodo, Hamzat and Owolabi.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been proposed to treat neuropathic pain but the quality of evidence remains low. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of neuronavigated rTMS to the primary motor cortex (M1) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in neuropathic pain over 25 weeks. We carried out a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at four outpatient clinics in France. Patients aged 18-75 years with peripheral neuropathic pain were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to M1 or DLPFC-rTMS and rerandomized at a 2:1 ratio to active or sham-rTMS (10 Hz, 3000 pulses/session, 15 sessions over 22 weeks). Patients and investigators were blind to treatment allocation. The primary end point was the comparison between active M1-rTMS, active DLPCF-rTMS and sham-rTMS for the change over the course of 25 weeks (Group × Time interaction) in average pain intensity (from 0 no pain to 10 maximal pain) on the Brief Pain Inventory, using a mixed model repeated measures analysis in patients who received at least one rTMS session (modified intention-to-treat population). Secondary outcomes included other measures of pain intensity and relief, sensory and affective dimensions of pain, quality of pain, self-reported pain intensity and fatigue (patients diary), Patient and Clinician Global Impression of Change (PGIC, CGIC), quality of life, sleep, mood and catastrophizing. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02010281. A total of 152 patients were randomized and 149 received treatment (49 for M1; 52 for DLPFC; 48 for sham). M1-rTMS reduced pain intensity versus sham-rTMS (estimate for Group × Session interaction: -0.048 ± 0.02; 95% CI: -0.09 to -0.01; P = 0.01). DLPFC-rTMS was not better than sham (estimate: -0.003 ± 0.01; 95% CI: -0.04 to 0.03, P = 0.9). M1-rRMS, but not DLPFC-rTMS, was also superior to sham-rTMS on pain relief, sensory dimension of pain, self-reported pain intensity and fatigue, PGIC and CGIC. There were no effects on quality of pain, mood, sleep and quality of life as all groups improved similarly over time. Headache was the most common side effect and occurred in 17 (34.7%), 23 (44.2%) and 13 (27.1%) patients from M1, DLPFC and sham groups, respectively (P = 0.2). Our results support the clinical relevance of M1-rTMS, but not of DLPFC-rTMS, for peripheral neuropathic pain with an excellent safety profile.  © 2021 The Author(s) (2021).

AB  - The chemical nature, the number length of integrated building blocks, as well as their sequence structure impact the phase morphology of multiblock copolymers (MBC) consisting of two non-miscible block types. We hypothesized that a strictly alternating sequence should favour phase segregation and in this way the elastic properties. A library of well-defined MBCs composed of two different hydrophobic, semi-crystalline blocks providing domains with well-separated melting temperatures (Tms) were synthesized from the same type of precursor building blocks as strictly alternating (MBCsalt) or random (MBCsran) MBCs and compared. Three different series of MBCsalt or MBCsran were synthesized by high-throughput synthesis by coupling oligo(ε-caprolactone) (OCL) of different molecular weights (2, 4, and 8 kDa) with oligotetrahydrofuran (OTHF, 2.9 kDa) via Steglich esterification in which the molar ratio of the reaction partners was slightly adjusted. Maximum of weight average molecular weight (Mw) were 65,000 g∙mol−1, 165,000 g∙mol−1, and 168,000 g∙mol−1 for MBCsalt and 80,500 g∙mol−1, 100,000 g∙mol−1, and 147,600 g∙mol−1 for MBCsran. When Mw increased, a decrease of both Tms associated to the melting of the OCL and OTHF domains was observed for all MBCs. Tm (OTHF) of MBCsran was always higher than Tm (OTHF) of MBCsalt, which was attributed to a better phase segregation. In addition, the elongation at break of MBCsalt was almost half as high when compared to MBCsran. In this way this study elucidates role of the block length and sequence structure in MBCs and enables a quantitative discussion of the structure-function relationship when two semi-crystalline block segments are utilized for the design of block copolymers. © 2020

AB  - Strokes are a growing cause of mortality and many stroke survivors suffer from motor impairment as well as other types of disabilities in their daily life activities. To treat these sequelae, motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems have shown potential to serve as an effective neurorehabilitation tool for post-stroke rehabilitation therapy. In this review, different MI-BCI based strategies, including “Functional Electric Stimulation, Robotics Assistance and Hybrid Virtual Reality based Models,” have been comprehensively reported for upper-limb neurorehabilitation. Each of these approaches have been presented to illustrate the in-depth advantages and challenges of the respective BCI systems. Additionally, the current state-of-the-art and main concerns regarding BCI based post-stroke neurorehabilitation devices have also been discussed. Finally, recommendations for future developments have been proposed while discussing the BCI neurorehabilitation systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Transmission maintenance scheduling (TMS) is an important optimization problem in the electricity distribution industry, with numerous variants studied and methods proposed over the last three decades. The ROADEF challenge 2020 addresses a novel version of the TMS problem, which stands out by having multiple time-dependent properties, constraints, and a risk-based aggregate objective function. Therefore, the problem is more complex than the previous formulations, and the existing methods are not directly applicable. This paper presents a method based on the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search metaheuristic. The method is compared with the best-known solutions from the challenge qualification phase, in which more than 70 teams participated. The result shows that the method yields consistent performance over the whole dataset, as the method finds the best-known solutions for half of the dataset and finds solutions consistently within 5h gap. © 2021 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - Neuroplasticity is a natural process occurring in the brain for the entire life. Stroke is the leading cause of long term disability and a huge medical and financial problem throughout the world. Research conducted over the past decade focused mainly on neuroprotection in the acute phase of stroke while very little studies target the chronic stage. Recovery after stroke depends on the ability of our brain to reestablish the structural and functional organization of neurovascular networks. Combining adjuvant therapies and drugs may enhance the repair processes and restore impaired brain functions. Currently, there are some drugs and rehabilitative strategies that can facilitate brain repair and improve clinical effect even years after stroke onset. Moreover, some of the compounds such as citicoline, fluoxetine, niacin, levodopa, etc. are already in clinical use or are being trialed in clinical issues. Many studies are also testing cell therapies; in our review, we focused on studies where cells have been implemented at the early stage of stroke. Next, we discuss pharmaceutical interventions. In this section, we selected methods of cognitive, behavioral, and physical rehabilitation as well as adjuvant interventions for neuroprotection including noninvasive brain stimulation and extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field. The modern rehabilitation represents a new model of physical interventions with the limited therapeutic window up to six months after stroke. However, previous studies suggest that the time window for stroke recovery is much longer than previously thought. This review attempts to present the progress in neuroprotec-tive strategies, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological that can stimulate the endogenous neuroplasticity in post-stroke patients. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Post-Stroke Depression (PSD) is a psychiatric disorder associated with stroke which has an adverse effect on the cognitive function and survival. It usually develops in 40% of the stroke survivors within 3 months. We performed a thorough literature review using PsychInfo, PubMed, Science Direct and PLOS databases for the non-pharmacological treatment of PSD. Early rehabilitation and psychological therapies are effective in treating depression in PSD while physiotherapy and music therapy improves both cognitive and movement disability. Transcranial stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy are invasive procedures used to treat cognitive impairment in PSD. Computerized therapy helps, enhance the attention, memory and executive functioning. DepReT stroke is a package which addresses patients along with their caregiver to have a better understanding of the depression. Robot assisted rehabilitation along with traditional rehabilitation is effective in treating motor function associated with PSD. Early assessment, treatment and rehabilitation are the most effective ways to prevent depression in stroke survivors and thereby improving their quality of life. Non-pharmacological treatment for post-stroke depression seem to be efficacious as antidepressants in improving depressive symptoms with minimal side effects. © 2020, Association of Pharmaceutical Teachers of India.

AB  - More than half of stroke patients live with different levels of motor dysfunction after receiving routine rehabilitation treatments. Therefore, new rehabilitation technologies are urgently needed as auxiliary treatments for motor rehabilitation. Based on routine rehabilitation treatments, a new intelligent rehabilitation platform has been developed for accurate evaluation of function and rehabilitation training. The emerging intelligent rehabilitation techniques can promote the development of motor function rehabilitation in terms of informatization, standardization, and intelligence. Traditional assessment methods are mostly subjective, depending on the experience and expertise of clinicians, and lack standardization and precision. It is therefore difficult to track functional changes during the rehabilitation process. Emerging intelligent rehabilitation techniques provide objective and accurate functional assessment for stroke patients that can promote improvement of clinical guidance for treatment. Artificial intelligence and neural networks play a critical role in intelligent rehabilitation. Multiple novel techniques, such as braincomputer interfaces, virtual reality, neural circuit-magnetic stimulation, and robot-assisted therapy, have been widely used in the clinic. This review summarizes the emerging intelligent rehabilitation techniques for the evaluation and treatment of motor dysfunction caused by nervous system diseases. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

AB  - Due to the high energy consumption and scalability challenges of deep learning, there is a critical need to shift research focus towards dealing with energy consumption constraints. Tsetlin Machines (TMs) are a recent approach to machine learning that has demonstrated significantly reduced energy usage compared to neural networks alike, while performing competitively accuracy-wise on several benchmarks. However, TMs rely heavily on energy-costly random number generation to stochastically guide a team of Tsetlin Automata (TA) to a Nash Equilibrium of the TM game. In this paper, we propose a novel finite-state learning automaton that can replace the TA in TM learning, for increased determinism. The new automaton uses multi-step deterministic state jumps to reinforce sub-patterns. Simultaneously, flipping a coin to skip every d’th state update ensures diversification by randomization. The d-parameter thus allows the degree of randomization to be finely controlled. E.g., d= 1 makes every update random and d= ∞ makes the automaton completely deterministic. Our empirical results show that, overall, only substantial degrees of determinism reduces accuracy. Energy-wise, random number generation constitutes switching energy consumption of the TM, saving up to 11 mW power for larger datasets with high d values. We can thus use the new d-parameter to trade off accuracy against energy consumption, to facilitate low-energy machine learning. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Background: Physical training is able to induce changes at neurophysiological and behavioral level associated with performance changes for the trained movements. The current study explores the effects of an additional intense robot-assisted upper extremity training on functional outcome and motor excitability in subacute stroke patients. Methods: Thirty moderately to severely affected patients < 3 months after stroke received a conventional inpatient rehabilitation. Based on a case–control principle 15 patients were assigned to receive additional 45 min of robot-assisted therapy (Armeo®Spring) 5 times per week (n = 15, intervention group, IG). The Fugl-Meyer Assessment for the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) was chosen as primary outcome parameter. Patients were tested before and after a 3-week treatment period as well as after a follow-up period of 2 weeks. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and cortical silent periods were recorded from the deltoid muscle on both sides before and after the intervention period to study effects at neurophysiological level. Statistical analysis was performed with non-parametric tests. Correlation analysis was done with Spearman´s rank correlation co-efficient. Results: Both groups showed a significant improvement in FMA-UE from pre to post (IG: + 10.6 points, control group (CG): + 7.3 points) and from post to follow-up (IG: + 3.9 points, CG: + 3.3 points) without a significant difference between them. However, at neurophysiological level post-intervention MEP amplitudes were significantly larger in the IG but not in the CG. The observed MEP amplitudes changes were positively correlated with FMA-UE changes and with the total amount of robot-assisted therapy. Conclusion: The additional robot-assisted therapy induced stronger excitability increases in the intervention group. However, this effect did not transduce to motor performance improvements at behavioral level. Trial registration The trial was registered in German Clinical Trials Register.

AB  - Introduction: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to modulate cortical plasticity, enhance motor learning and post-stroke upper extremity motor recovery. It has also been demonstrated to facilitate activation of brain-computer interface (BCI) in stroke patients. We had previously demonstrated that BCI-assisted motor imagery (MI-BCI) can improve upper extremity impairment in chronic stroke participants. This study was carried out to investigate the effects of priming with tDCS prior to MI-BCI training in chronic stroke patients with moderate to severe upper extremity paresis and to investigate the cortical activity changes associated with training. Methods: This is a double-blinded randomized clinical trial. Participants were randomized to receive 10 sessions of 20-min 1 mA tDCS or sham-tDCS before MI-BCI, with the anode applied to the ipsilesional, and the cathode to the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1). Upper extremity sub-scale of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (UE-FM) and corticospinal excitability measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were assessed before, after and 4 weeks after intervention. Results: Ten participants received real tDCS and nine received sham tDCS. UE-FM improved significantly in both groups after intervention. Of those with unrecordable motor evoked potential (MEP-) to the ipsilesional M1, significant improvement in UE-FM was found in the real-tDCS group, but not in the sham group. Resting motor threshold (RMT) of ipsilesional M1 decreased significantly after intervention in the real-tDCS group. Short intra-cortical inhibition (SICI) in the contralesional M1 was reduced significantly following intervention in the sham group. Correlation was found between baseline UE-FM score and changes in the contralesional SICI for all, as well as between changes in UE-FM and changes in contralesional RMT in the MEP- group. Conclusion: MI-BCI improved the motor function of the stroke-affected arm in chronic stroke patients with moderate to severe impairment. tDCS did not confer overall additional benefit although there was a trend toward greater benefit. Cortical activity changes in the contralesional M1 associated with functional improvement suggests a possible role for the contralesional M1 in stroke recovery in more severely affected patients. This has important implications in designing neuromodulatory interventions for future studies and tailoring treatment.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a powerful and non-invasive technique to stimulate nerve cells in the brain to improve symptoms of depression. It needs accurate contact force and positioning of a stimulating coil to offer effective treatment. Conventionally, a neurologist has to manually place the coil on the patient’s head at a predefined position and orientation throughout the 30-to-45-minute treatment. This paper consequently highlights the design of a robot control framework used for the transcranial magnetic stimulation. The hybrid Proportional-Derivative position and Proportional–Integral force control scheme was successfully implemented on the effective robotic system. The system can track the head movement by using the Kinect camera and simultaneously maintain the contact force between the magnetic coil and the head in real-time. The optimal gain tuning technique was adopted. It delivered PD gains of (Formula presented.) = 75.0, (Formula presented.) =2.0 and PI gains of (Formula presented.) = 0.09 and (Formula presented.) = 0.011, respectively. This provides a faster response of the robot end-effector with a small interactive force error. The experimental results show that when the head has translational and rotational motions, the robot-assisted transcranial magnetic stimulation control system performs with a safe and reliable manner validated by the quantitative measurement. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group and The Robotics Society of Japan.

AB  - Light touch with an earth-fixed reference point improves balance during quite standing. In our current study, we implemented a paradigm to assess the effects of disrupting the right posterior parietal cortex on dynamic stabilization of body sway with and without Light Touch after a graded, unpredictable mechanical perturbation. We hypothesized that the benefit of Light Touch would be amplified in the more dynamic context of an external perturbation, reducing body sway and muscle activations before, at and after a perturbation. Furthermore, we expected sway stabilization would be impaired following disruption of the right Posterior Parietal Cortex as a result of increased postural stiffness. Thirteen young adults stood blindfolded in Tandem-Romberg stance on a force plate and were required either to keep light fingertip contact to an earth-fixed reference point or to stand without fingertip contact. During every trial, a robotic arm pushed a participant’s right shoulder in medio-lateral direction. The testing consisted of 4 blocks before TMS stimulation and 8 blocks after, which alternated between Light Touch and No Touch conditions. In summary, we found a strong effect of Light Touch, which resulted in improved stability following a perturbation. Light Touch decreased the immediate sway response, steady state sway following re-stabilization, as well as muscle activity of the Tibialis Anterior. Furthermore, we saw gradual decrease of muscle activity over time, which indicates an adaptive process following exposure to repetitive trials of perturbations. We were not able to confirm our hypothesis that disruption of the rPPC leads to increased postural stiffness. However, after disruption of the rPPC, muscle activity of the Tibialis Anterior is decreased more compared to sham. We conclude that rPPC disruption enhanced the intra-session adaptation to the disturbing effects of the perturbation. © 2020 Kaulmann et al.

AB  - For physiological brain function a particular balance between excitation and inhibition is essential. Paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can estimate cortical excitability and the relative contribution of inhibitory and excitatory networks. Combining TMS with electroencephalography (EEG) enables additional assessment of the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal responses in the stimulated brain. This study aims to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics and stability of single and paired pulse TMS-EEG responses, and assess long intracortical inhibition (LICI) at the cortical level. Twenty-five healthy subjects were studied twice, approximately one week apart. Manual coil positioning was applied in sixteen subjects and robot-guided positioning in nine. Both motor cortices were stimulated with 50 single pulses and 50 paired pulses at each of the five interstimulus intervals (ISIs): 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 ms. To assess stability and LICI, the intraclass correlation coefficient and cluster-based permutation analysis were used. We found great resemblance in the topographical distribution of the characteristic TMS-EEG components for single and paired pulse TMS. Stimulation of the dominant and non-dominant hemisphere resulted in a mirrored spatiotemporal dynamics. No significant effect on the TMS-EEG responses was found for either stimulated hemisphere, time or coil positioning method, indicating the stability of both single and paired pulse TMS-EEG responses. For all ISIs, LICI was characterized by significant suppression of the late N100 and P180 components in the central areas, without affecting the early P30, N45 and P60 components. These observations in healthy subjects can serve as reference values for future neuropsychiatric and pharmacological studies. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The recovery of walking capacity is one of the main aims in stroke rehabilitation. Being able to predict if and when a patient is going to walk after stroke is of major interest in terms of management of the patients and their family’s expectations and in terms of discharge destination and timing previsions. This article reviews the recent literature regarding the predictive factors for gait recovery and the best recommendations in terms of gait rehabilitation in stroke patients. Trunk control and lower limb motor control (e.g. hip extensor muscle force) seem to be the best predictors of gait recovery as shown by the TWIST algorithm, which is a simple tool that can be applied in clinical practice at 1 week post-stroke. In terms of walking performance, the 6-min walking test is the best predictor of community ambulation. Various techniques are available for gait rehabilitation, including treadmill training with or without body weight support, robotic-assisted therapy, virtual reality, circuit class training and self-rehabilitation programmes. These techniques should be applied at specific timing during post-stroke rehabilitation, according to patient’s functional status. © 2020, Belgian Neurological Society.

AB  - Stroke disturbs both the structural and functional integrity of the brain. The understanding of stroke pathophysiology has improved greatly in the past several decades. However, effective therapy is still limited, especially for patients who are in the subacute or chronic phase. Multiple novel therapies have been developed to improve clinical outcomes by improving brain plasticity. These approaches either focus on improving brain remodeling and restoration or on constructing a neural bypass to avoid brain injury. This review describes emerging therapies, including modern rehabilitation, brain stimulation, cell therapy, brain-computer interfaces, and peripheral nervous transfer, and highlights treatment-induced plasticity. Key evidence from basic studies on the underlying mechanisms is also briefly discussed. These insights should lead to a deeper understanding of the overall neural circuit changes, the clinical relevance of these changes in stroke, and stroke treatment progress, which will assist in the development of future approaches to enhance brain function after stroke. © Copyright © 2020 Su and Xu.

AB  - Stroke is the third leading cause of long-term disability. Effective stroke rehabilitation should be provided to patients with a moderate or severe stroke so as to achieve functional recovery. Also, stroke rehabilitation is moving towards more intense therapy models that incorporate technologies such as robotics and computer games. Evidence-based guidelines are useful for promoting the best possible clinical practices. This guideline summarises the modes of stroke rehabilitation in China -three-stage rehabilitation network, rehabilitation of stroke dysfunction, training for activities of daily living, stroke complications and rehabilitation care. The aim of this guideline was to provide a synopsis of best clinical practices in the stroke rehabilitation of adult patients in China.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

AB  - This paper presents the development of a robotized Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) system, as robotic assistance brings crucial benefits of the TMS to provide a more adequate, accuracy and reliable manner. A 6-DOF KUKA KR-16 robot, an ATI-multi-axis force/torque sensor and a Kinect 3D camera were used to develop the robotized TMS. All electrical signals were strategically processed by a host ROS-computer. Real-time hybrid position/force control based on Proportional Integral and Derivative (PID) control and Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) was successfully implemented to ensure effective human-robot collaboration. The results claimed that the performance of the control schemes based on the PID and FLC control approaches were evidently acceptable for the robotized TMS application. However, in-depth observation exposed that the FLC method resulted to be slightly superior to the PID control by actively compensating for the dynamics in the non-linear system. © 2020 Zibeline International Publishing Sdn.

AB  - A vision-based head tracking method for robotic transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), requiring no attachments to patient, is proposed to track the movements of patient's head during treatment. First, a facial landmark detection method based on Constrained Local Neural Field (CLNF) algorithm is used. Second, a method of head location and pose estimation is presented and a filter for image restoration is used for a higher accuracy. Finally, calibration approaches are proposed based on the coordinates of the robot arm and camera and real-time motion tracking system. Experiment results indicate that the accuracy and real-time performance of this head tracking method satisfy the requirements of TMS treatment.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Circular economy emphasizes the idea of transforming products involving economic growth and improving the ecological system to reduce the negative consequences caused by the excessive use of raw materials. This can be achieved with the use of second-generation biomass that converts industrial and agricultural wastes into bulk chemicals. The use of catalytic processes is essential to achieve a viable upgrade of biofuels from the lignocellulosic biomass. We carried out density functional theory calculations to explore the relationship between 13 transition metals (TMs) properties, as catalysts, and their affinity for hydrogen and oxygen, as key species in the valourization of biomass. The relation of these parameters will define the trends of the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process on biomass-derived compounds. We found the hydrogen and oxygen adsorption energies in the most stable site have a linear relation with electronic properties of these metals that will rationalize the surface's ability to bind the biomass-derived compounds and break the C-O bonds. This will accelerate the catalyst innovation for low temperature and efficient HDO processes on biomass derivates, e.g. guaiacol and anisole, among others. Among the monometallic catalysts explored, the scaling relationship pointed out that Ni has a promising balance between hydrogen and oxygen affinities according to the d-band centre and d-band width models. The comparison of the calculated descriptors to the adsorption strength of guaiacol on the investigated surfaces indicates that the d-band properties alone are not best suited to describe the trend. Instead, we found that a linear combination of work function and d-band properties gives significantly better correlation. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Science to enable the circular economy'.  © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Because of the sharply growing interest worldwide of “hard” physical-mechanical robot systems for the execution of on-site construction tasks [i.e. single-task construction robots (STCRs)], the purpose of this study is to equip development projects with a systematic design-management system model that allows to integrate the different needs and aims of stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes a STCR-technology management system (STCR-TMS) for the complete development cycle of STCR designs. The STCR-TMS is based on established principles from systems engineering and management and STCR-specific activities developed and tested by the authors as standalone elements in previous research work. Findings: The application of the STCR-TMS revealed the practicability of the method and the underlying concepts to provide practical guidance for the development process. Additional findings indicate that the method is sufficiently generic and flexible for application to different types of robots and indifferent world regions. This research has also shown that key activities need to be addressed to increase the practicability of the STCR-TMS. Originality/value: A unique characteristic of this method is the evolution with each utilization cycle. In addition, individual elements are interchangeable and can be adapted based on external circumstances. These properties allow the TMS to be applied to other fields in construction robotics. With the progression of the verification and validation of the method, know-how and certain elements can be fed into standardization activities (e.g. establishing a management system standard). © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In Underwater exploration, umbilical cord or tether cables are used to provide data transfer, electrical power and control commands to underwater robots and surface vessels. Umbilicals are also useful for anchoring, mooring, and for the deployment of underwater sensors. In general, tethers are naturally buoyant and are designed to work under rough sea conditions and is managed via the Tether Management Systems(TMS). In a limited-size environment such as nuclear environment inspection, multiple ROVs may be deployed and due to the density of various objects underwater, tangles and loops tend to form in low-tension zones due to residual torsion and flexure. The formation of tangles could hinder the operation of the ROV, and attenuate signal transmission in fibre-optic cables due to formed knots and kinks on the cables. Moreover, the risk of collection and entanglements is even increased if the ROV is equipped with manipulators that may tangle with the tether. In this paper, a novel robotics tether system is developed that is capable of navigating in the water to prevent loops and tangles and avoid obstacles. The developments of the system is a bio-inspired design that mimics the motion of a snake in the water. The design of the system single unit consists of a double $\mu$thrust system that is designed to be fitted on the tether. The developed system is distributed in the form of sections on the tether cable. The $\mu$thruster implement a specific pulse thrust according to the distance from an object to prevent collection and entanglement. To effectively simulate the proposed system, a tether cable is simulated for three types of cases, traditional tether, constant thrust tether and constant thrust with wave pattern. Moreover, the initial experiments in the hydrodynamics lab tank showed efficient locomotion of the tether cable away from obstacles.  © 2021 MTS.

AB  - The modular organization of the cortex refers to subsets of highly interconnected nodes, sharing specific cytoarchitectural and dynamical properties. These properties condition the level of excitability of local pools of neurons. In this study, we described TMS evoked potentials (TEP) input–output properties to provide new insights into regional cortical excitability. We combined robotized TMS with EEG to disentangle region-specific TEP from threshold to saturation and describe their oscillatory contents. Twenty-two young healthy participants received robotized TMS pulses over the right primary motor cortex (M1), the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the right superior occipital lobe (SOL) at five stimulation intensities (40, 60, 80, 100, and 120% resting motor threshold) and one short-interval intracortical inhibition condition during EEG recordings. Ten additional subjects underwent the same experiment with a realistic sham TMS procedure. The results revealed interregional differences in the TEPs input–output functions as well as in the responses to paired-pulse conditioning protocols, when considering early local components (<80 ms). Each intensity in the three regions was associated with complex patterns of oscillatory activities. The quality of the regression of TEPs over stimulation intensity was used to derive a new readout for cortical excitability and dynamical properties, revealing lower excitability in the DLPFC, followed by SOL and M1. The realistic sham experiment confirmed that these early local components were not contaminated by multisensory stimulations. This study provides an entirely new analytic framework to characterize input–output relations throughout the cortex, paving the way to a more accurate definition of local cortical excitability. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The communication through coherence hypothesis suggests that only coherently oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively and predicts an intrinsic response modulation along the oscillatory rhythm. For the motor cortex (MC) at rest, the oscillatory cycle has been shown to determine the brain's responsiveness to external stimuli. For the active MC, however, the demonstration of such a phase-specific modulation of corticospinal excitability (CSE) along the rhythm cycle is still missing. Motor evoked potentials in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the MC were used to probe the effect of cortical oscillations on CSE during several motor conditions. A brain-machine interface (BMI) with a robotic hand orthosis allowed investigating effects of cortical activity on CSE without the confounding effects of voluntary muscle activation. Only this BMI approach (and not active or passive hand opening alone) revealed a frequency- and phase-specific cortical modulation of CSE by sensorimotor beta-band activity that peaked once per oscillatory cycle and was independent of muscle activity. The active MC follows an intrinsic response modulation in accordance with the communication through coherence hypothesis. Furthermore, the BMI approach may facilitate and strengthen effective corticospinal communication in a therapeutic context, for example, when voluntary hand opening is no longer possible after stroke. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an important technology in neurological diagnostics and therapy. The limited output voltage shape of modern TM stimulators constrains the research about the targeted stimulation of individual brain parts. This paper introduces a novel TM stimulator based on a cascaded H-bridge inverter topology. Using a large number of sub-modules (e.g., ten), a nearly arbitrary output voltage waveform can be generated. Within the frame of this paper, the design and testing of an individual H-bridge module, using low-voltage MOSFETs, is explained in detail. To achieve a high current capability, the switching waveforms of the paralleled MOSFETs are synchronized by individual time delays introduced by an integrated CPLD. The H-bridge module is used for different experimental pulse tests. Using a DC link voltage of 180 V a maximum current peak of about 2.1 kA is achieved. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate neurophysiological alterations within the typical symptomatic period after concussion (1-month) and throughout recovery (6-months) in adolescents; and (2) to examine relationships between neurophysiological and upper limb kinematic outcomes. METHODS: 18 adolescents with concussion were compared to 17 healthy controls. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to assess neurophysiological differences between groups including: short- and long-interval intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation, short- and long-latency afferent inhibition, afferent facilitation, and transcallosal inhibition (TCI). Behavioral measures of upper limb kinematics were assessed with a robotic device. RESULTS: Mixed model analysis of neurophysiological data identified two key findings. First, participants with concussion demonstrated delayed onset of interhemispheric inhibition, as indexed by TCI, compared to healthy controls. Second, our exploratory analysis indicated that the magnitude of TCI onset delay in adolescents with concussion was related to upper limb kinematics. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that concussion in adolescence alters interhemispheric communication. We note relationships between neurophysiological and kinematic data, suggesting an affinity for individuals with less concussion-related physiological change to improve their motor behavior over time. These data serve as an important step in future development of assessments (neurobiological and clinical) and interventions for concussion. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Theoretical and empirical work suggest that addictive drugs potentiate dopaminergic reinforcement learning signals and disrupt the reward function of its neural targets, including the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) and the basal ganglia. Here, we aim to use prefrontal 10-Hz TMS to enhance aMCC reward activity and reward learning by the basal ganglia in problematic substance users. Methods: 22 problematic substance users were randomized into an Active and SHAM (coil flipped) TMS group. We recorded the reward positivity—an electrophysiological signal believed to index sensitivity of the aMCC to rewards—while participants engaged in 4 blocks (100 trials per block) of a reward-based choice task. A robotic arm positioned a TMS coil over a prefrontal cortex target, and 50 pulses were delivered at 10-Hz before every 10 trials of blocks 2–4 (1500 pulses, 400 trials). Participants then completed a decision-making task that is diagnostic of striatal dopamine dysfunction. Results: The present study revealed three main findings. First, both groups failed to elicit a reward positivity during the first two task blocks. Second, applying robot-assisted TMS enhanced the amplitude of the reward positivity in the Active group, but not the SHAM group, across the last two task blocks. Third, the Active group performed relatively better at reward-based learning than the SHAM group. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that 10-Hz TMS is successful in modulating the reward function of the aMCC and basal ganglia in problematic substance users, which may have utility in the treatment of reward-related neural dysfunction commonly associated with substance use disorders. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Stroke affects 33 million individuals worldwide every year and is one of the prime causes of paralysis. Due to partial or full paralysis, most of the patients affected by stroke depend on caregivers for the rest of their lives. Easy and efficient communication from the patient to the caregiver is a vital parameter determining the quality of life during rehabilitation. Several solutions, such as brain-computer interface (BCI) systems and exoskeletons, are proposed for post-stroke rehabilitation. But, most of these devices are expensive, sophisticated, and put an additional burden on the patient. Also, the communication between the patient and the caregiver is insecure. In this article, the brain-to-brain interface technique is integrated with an efficient encryption algorithm to enable secure transmission of information from the patient's brain to the caregiver. When a patient thinks of a word or a number, the thought is transmitted with the help of an electroencephalogram (EEG) headset through a wireless medium to the recipient, who correctly interprets the thoughts conveyed by the sender and types the same alphabet on the keyboard at his/her end. The transmitted message at the edge is encrypted with a lightweight novel tiny symmetric algorithm (NTSA), which can only be decrypted at the edge receiver. The Internet of Things integrated system is also flexible to send signals to multiple caregivers at the same time. The proposed method tested on ten users gave an average effective concentration percentage of 78.9% along with the secure transmission, which is a significant result compared with existing solutions. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Objective: To compare the effects of unilateral, proximal arm robot-assisted therapy combined with hand functional electrical stimulation with intensive conventional therapy for restoring arm function in survivors of subacute stroke. Design: This was a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Inpatient rehabilitation university hospital. Participants: Patients (N=40) diagnosed as having ischemic stroke (time since stroke <8wk) and upper limb impairment were enrolled. Interventions: Participants randomized to the experimental group received 30 sessions (5 sessions/wk) of robot-assisted arm therapy and hand functional electrical stimulation (RAT+FES). Participants randomized to the control group received a time-matched intensive conventional therapy. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was arm motor recovery measured with the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment. Secondary outcomes included motor function, arm spasticity, and activities of daily living. Measurements were performed at baseline, after 3 weeks, at the end of treatment, and at 6-month follow-up. Presence of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) was also measured at baseline. Results: Both groups significantly improved all outcome measures except for spasticity without differences between groups. Patients with moderate impairment and presence of MEPs who underwent early rehabilitation (<30d post stroke) demonstrated the greatest clinical improvements. Conclusions: RAT+FES was no more effective than intensive conventional arm training. However, at the same level of arm impairment and corticospinal tract integrity, it induced a higher level of arm recovery. © 2019 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine

AB  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) can be used to map cortical motor topography by spatially sampling the sensorimotor cortex while recording Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP) with surface electromyography (EMG). Traditional sampling strategies are time-consuming and inefficient, as they ignore the fact that responsive sites are typically sparse and highly spatially correlated. An alternative approach, commonly employed when TMS mapping is used for presurgical planning, is to leverage the expertise of the coil operator to use MEPs elicited by previous stimuli as feedback to decide which loci to stimulate next. In this paper, we propose to automatically infer optimal future stimulus loci using active learning Gaussian Process-based sampling in place of user expertise. We first compare the user-guided (USRG) method to the traditional grid selection method and randomized sampling to verify that the USRG approach has superior performance. We then compare several novel active Gaussian Process (GP) strategies with the USRG approach. Experimental results using real data show that, as expected, the USRG method is superior to the grid and random approach in both time efficiency and MEP map accuracy. We also found that an active warped GP entropy and a GP random-based strategy performed equally as well as, or even better than, the USRG method. These methods were completely automatic, and succeeded in efficiently sampling the regions in which the MEP response variations are largely confined. This work provides the foundation for highly efficient, fully automatized TMS mapping, especially when considered in the context of advances in robotic coil operation. © 2001-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Most cases of hemiparetic cerebral palsy are caused by perinatal stroke, resulting in lifelong disability for millions of people. However, our understanding of how the motor system develops following such early unilateral brain injury is increasing. Tools such as neuroimaging and brain stimulation are generating informed maps of the unique motor networks that emerge following perinatal stroke. As a focal injury of defined timing in an otherwise healthy brain, perinatal stroke represents an ideal human model of developmental plasticity. Here, we provide an introduction to perinatal stroke epidemiology and outcomes, before reviewing models of developmental plasticity after perinatal stroke. We then examine existing therapeutic approaches, including constraint, bimanual and other occupational therapies, and their potential synergy with non-invasive neurostimulation. We end by discussing the promise of exciting new therapies, including novel neurostimulation, brain–computer interfaces and robotics, all focused on improving outcomes after perinatal stroke. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Previous research has suggested that the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) is involved with visual decision making, and specifically with the accumulation of information leading to a decision. In humans, this research has been primarily based on imaging and electroencephalography (EEG), and as such only correlational. One line of such research has led to a model of three spatially distributed brain networks that activate in temporal sequence to enable visual decision-making. The model predicted that disturbing neural processing in the LOC at a specific latency would slow object decision-making, increasing reaction time (RT) in a difficult discrimination task. We utilized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test this prediction, perturbing LOC beginning at 400 ms post-stimulus onset, a time in the model corresponding to LOC activation at a particular difficulty level, with the expectation of increased RT. Thirteen healthy adults participated in two TMS sessions in which left and right LOC were stimulated separately utilizing neuronavigation and robotic coil guidance. Participants performed a two-alternative forced-choice task selecting whether a car or face was present on each trial amidst visual noise pre-tested to approximate a 75% accuracy level. In an effort to disrupt processing, pairs of TMS pulses separated by 50 ms were presented at one of five stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs): −200, 200, 400, 450, or 500 ms. Behavioral performance differed systematically across SOAs for RT and accuracy measures. As predicted, TMS at 400 ms resulted in a significant slowing of RT. TMS delivered at −200 ms resulted in faster RT, indicating early stimulation may result in priming and performance enhancement. Use of TMS thus causally demonstrated the involvement of LOC in this task, and more broadly with perceptual decision-making; additionally, it demonstrated the role of TMS in testing well-developed neural models of perceptual processing. © Copyright © 2020 Luber, Jangraw, Appelbaum, Harrison, Hilbig, Beynel, Jones, Sajda and Lisanby.

AB  - Spinal cord injury is linked to the interruption of neural pathways, which results in irreversible neural dysfunction. Neural repair and neuroregeneration are critical goals and issues for rehabilitation in spinal cord injury, which require neural stem cell repair and multimodal neuromodulation techniques involving personalized rehabilitation strategies. Besides the involvement of endogenous stem cells in neurogenesis and neural repair, exogenous neural stem cell transplantation is an emerging effective method for repairing and replacing damaged tissues in central nervous system diseases. However, to ensure that endogenous or exogenous neural stem cells truly participate in neural repair following spinal cord injury, appropriate interventional measures (e.g., neuromodulation) should be adopted. Neuromodulation techniques, such as noninvasive magnetic stimulation and electrical stimulation, have been safely applied in many neuropsychiatric diseases. There is increasing evidence to suggest that neuromagnetic/electrical modulation promotes neuroregeneration and neural repair by affecting signaling in the nervous system; namely, by exciting, inhibiting, or regulating neuronal and neural network activities to improve motor function and motor learning following spinal cord injury. Several studies have indicated that fine motor skill rehabilitation training makes use of residual nerve fibers for collateral growth, encourages the formation of new synaptic connections to promote neural plasticity, and improves motor function recovery in patients with spinal cord injury. With the development of biomaterial technology and biomechanical engineering, several emerging treatments have been developed, such as robots, brain-computer interfaces, and nanomaterials. These treatments have the potential to help millions of patients suffering from motor dysfunction caused by spinal cord injury. However, large-scale clinical trials need to be conducted to validate their efficacy. This review evaluated the efficacy of neural stem cells and magnetic or electrical stimulation combined with rehabilitation training and intelligent therapies for spinal cord injury according to existing evidence, to build up a multimodal treatment strategy of spinal cord injury to enhance nerve repair and regeneration. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can relieve motor symptoms related to psychogenic movement disorders (PMDs), but the subtending neurophysiological basis is unclear. We report on a 50-year-old woman with a diagnosis of psychogenic myoclonus in the right lower limb, who was treated with a daily session (in the late morning/early afternoon) of 1 Hz rTMS over the left premotor cortex (PMC), five times a week for 6 weeks. Clinical data and EEG at rest were collected before and immediately and 2-month after the rTMS protocol completion. The patient reported a significant reduction of involuntary movement frequency and intensity and the related disability burden up to the follow-up. In parallel, any abnormality in terms of source current density within and connectivity between the frontal and parietal areas was reset. The short follow–up period, the lack of extensive neurophysiological measures, and the lack of control treatment represent the main limitation of the study. However, low-frequency rTMS over PMC seems a safe and promising approach for the management of psychogenic myoclonus owing to the combination of cortical neuromodulation and non-specific mechanisms suggesting cognitive-behavioral effects. © Copyright © 2020 Naro, Pignolo, Billeri, Porcari, Portaro, Tonin and Calabrò.

AB  - It is extremely difficult and expensive to operate a traditional remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in the deep-sea. In this paper, a novel small-scale deep-sea resident ROV, called Rover ROV, is designed to conduct regional fine-sounding operations. The Rover ROV does not require a complicated Launch and Recovery System (LARS) equipped on a surface vessel, instead, the Rover ROV can be placed on a deep-sea lander and diving to the seafloor together. To ensure sufficient energy for the Rover ROV and meanwhile reduce the complexity of the conventional Tether Management System (TMS), a combined energy supply scheme based on floating charging technology is proposed. This power supply solution avoids relying solely on strong cables to provide power. To validating the maneuverability of the self-developed resident ROV and the effectiveness of the combined energy supply solution, Field experiments have been conducted in the South China Sea area with a depth of 3000 m. The results show that the developed small-scale resident ROV system can be operated in deep-sea high-power scenario, which verifies the higher reliability and longtime working capability of the proposed system.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Background: A novel electromechanical robotic-exoskeleton was designed in-house for the rehabilitation of wrist joint and Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. Objective: The objective was to compare the rehabilitation effectiveness (clinical-scales and neurophysiological-measures) of robotic-therapy training sessions with dose-matched conventional therapy in patients with stroke. Methods: A pilot prospective parallel randomized controlled study at clinical settings was designed for patients with stroke within 2 years of chronicity. Patients were randomly assigned to receive an intervention of 20 sessions of 45 min each, five days a week for four weeks, in Robotic-therapy Group (RG) (n = 12) and conventional upper-limb rehabilitation in Control-Group (CG) (n = 11). We intended to evaluate the effects of a novel exoskeleton based therapy on the functional rehabilitation outcomes of upper-limb and cortical-excitability in patients with stroke as compared to the conventional-rehabilitation. Clinical-scales– Modified Ashworth Scale, Active Range of Motion, Barthel-Index, Brunnstrom-stage and Fugl-Meyer (FM) scale and neurophysiological measures of cortical-excitability (using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) –Motor Evoked Potential and Resting Motor threshold, were acquired pre- and post-therapy. Results: No side effects were noticed in any of the patients. Both RG and CG showed significant (p < 0.05) improvement in all clinical motor-outcomes except Modified Ashworth Scale in CG. RG showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher improvement over CG in Modified Ashworth Scale, Active Range of Motion and Fugl-Meyer scale and FM Wrist-/Hand component. An increase in cortical-excitability in ipsilesional-hemisphere was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05) in RG over CG, as indexed by a decrease in Resting Motor Threshold and increase in the amplitude of Motor Evoked Potential. No significant changes were shown by the contralesional-hemisphere. Interhemispheric RMT-asymmetry evidenced significant (p < 0.05) changes in RG over CG indicating increased cortical-excitability in ipsilesional-hemisphere along with interhemispheric changes. Conclusion: Robotic-exoskeleton training showed improvement in motor outcomes and cortical-excitability in patients with stroke. Neurophysiological changes in RG could most likely be a consequence of plastic reorganization and use-dependent plasticity. Trial registry number: ISRCTN95291802 © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) coupled to robotic assistive devices have shown promise for the rehabilitation of stroke patients. However, little has been reported that compares the clinical and physiological effects of a BCI intervention for upper limb stroke rehabilitation with those of conventional therapy. This study assesses the feasibility of an intervention with a BCI based on electroencephalography (EEG) coupled to a robotic hand orthosis for upper limb stroke rehabilitation and compares its outcomes to conventional therapy. Seven subacute and three chronic stroke patients (M = 59.9 ± 12.8) with severe upper limb impairment were recruited in a crossover feasibility study to receive 1 month of BCI therapy and 1 month of conventional therapy in random order. The outcome measures were comprised of: Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), motor evoked potentials elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), hand dynamometry, and EEG. Additionally, BCI performance and user experience were measured. All measurements were acquired before and after each intervention. FMA-UE and ARAT after BCI (23.1 ± 16; 8.4 ± 10) and after conventional therapy (21.9 ± 15; 8.7 ± 11) were significantly higher (p < 0.017) compared to baseline (17.5 ± 15; 4.3 ± 6) but were similar between therapies (p > 0.017). Via TMS, corticospinal tract integrity could be assessed in the affected hemisphere of three patients at baseline, in five after BCI, and four after conventional therapy. While no significant difference (p > 0.05) was found in patients’ affected hand strength, it was higher after the BCI therapy. EEG cortical activations were significantly higher over motor and non-motor regions after both therapies (p < 0.017). System performance increased across BCI sessions, from 54 (50, 70%) to 72% (56, 83%). Patients reported moderate mental workloads and excellent usability with the BCI. Outcome measurements implied that a BCI intervention using a robotic hand orthosis as feedback has the potential to elicit neuroplasticity-related mechanisms, similar to those observed during conventional therapy, even in a group of severely impaired stroke patients. Therefore, the proposed BCI system could be a suitable therapy option and will be further assessed in clinical trials. © Copyright © 2021 Cantillo-Negrete, Carino-Escobar, Carrillo-Mora, Rodriguez-Barragan, Hernandez-Arenas, Quinzaños-Fresnedo, Hernandez-Sanchez, Galicia-Alvarado, Miguel-Puga and Arias-Carrion.

AB  - Levodopa-induced dyskinesia gradually emerges during long-Term dopamine therapy, causing major disability in patients with Parkinson disease. Using pharmacodynamic functional MRI, we have previously shown that the intake of levodopa triggers an excessive activation of the pre-supplementary motor area in Parkinson disease patients with peak-of-dose dyskinesia. In this pre-registered, interventional study, we tested whether the abnormal responsiveness of the pre-supplementary motor area to levodopa may constitute a 'stimulation target' for treating dyskinesia. A gender-balanced group of 17 Parkinson disease patients with peak-of-dose dyskinesia received 30 min of robot-Assisted repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, after they had paused their anti-Parkinson medication. Real-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation at 100% or sham-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation at 30% of individual resting corticomotor threshold of left first dorsal interosseous muscle was applied on separate days in counterbalanced order. Following repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, patients took 200 mg of oral levodopa and underwent functional MRI to map brain activity, while they performed the same go/no-go task as in our previous study. Blinded video assessment revealed that real-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation delayed the onset of dyskinesia and reduced its severity relative to sham-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Individual improvement in dyskinesia severity scaled linearly with the modulatory effect of real-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on task-related activation in the pre-supplementary motor area. Stimulation-induced delay in dyskinesia onset correlated positively with the induced electrical field strength in the pre-supplementary motor area. Our results provide converging evidence that the levodopa-Triggered increase in pre-supplementary motor area activity plays a causal role in the pathophysiology of peak-of-dose dyskinesia and constitutes a promising cortical target for brain stimulation therapy. © 2020 The Author(s) (2020).

AB  - Background: It is well established that proprioception (position sense) is important for motor control, yet its role in motor learning and associated plasticity is not well understood. We previously demonstrated that motor skill learning is associated with enhanced proprioception and changes in sensorimotor neurophysiology. However, the neural substrates mediating these effects are unclear. Objective: To determine whether suppressing activity in the cerebellum and somatosensory cortex (S1) affects proprioceptive changes associated with motor skill learning. Methods: 54 healthy young adults practiced a skill involving visually-guided 2D reaching movements through an irregular-shaped track using a robotic manipulandum with their right hand. Proprioception was measured using a passive two-alternative choice task before and after motor practice. Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) was delivered over S1 or the cerebellum (CB) at the end of training for two consecutive days. We compared group differences (S1, CB, Sham) in proprioception and motor skill, quantified by a speed-accuracy function, measured on a third consecutive day (retention). Results: As shown previously, the Sham group demonstrated enhanced proprioceptive sensitivity after training and at retention. The S1 group had impaired proprioceptive function at retention through online changes during practice, whereas the CB group demonstrated offline decrements in proprioceptive function. All groups demonstrated motor skill learning. However, the magnitude of learning differed between the CB and Sham groups, consistent with a role for the cerebellum in motor learning. Conclusion: Overall, these findings suggest that the cerebellum and S1 are important for distinct aspects of proprioceptive changes during skill learning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is an important treatment option for medication resistant depression. It uses an electromagnetic coil that needs to be positioned accurately at a specific location and angle next to the head such that specific brain areas are stimulated. Existing image-guided neuronavigation systems allow accurate targeting but add cost, training and setup times, preventing their wide-spread use in the clinic. Mixed-reality neuronavigation can help mitigate these issues and thereby enable more widespread use of image-based neuronavigation by providing a much more intuitive and streamlined visualization of the target. A mixed-reality neuronavigation system requires two core functionalities: 1) tracking of the patient's head and 2) visualization of targeting-related information. Here we focus on the head tracking functionality and compare three different head tracking methods for a mixed-reality neuronavigation system. Methods: We integrated three head tracking methods into the mixed reality neuronavigation framework and measured their accuracy. Specifically, we experimented with (a) marker-based tracking with a mixed reality headset (optical see-through head-mounted display (OST-HMD)) camera, (b) marker-based tracking with a world-anchored camera and (c) markerless RGB-depth (RGB-D) tracking with a world-anchored camera. To measure the accuracy of each approach, we measured the distance between real-world and virtual target points on a mannequin head. Results: The mean tracking error for the initial head pose and the head rotated by 10° and 30° for the three methods respectively was: (a) 3.54±1.10 mm, 3.79±1.78 mm and 4.08±1.88 mm, (b) 3.97±1.41 mm, 6.01±2.51 mm and 6.84±3.48 mm, (c) 3.16±2.26 mm, 4.46±2.30 mm and 5.83±3.70 mm. Conclusion: For the initial head pose, all three methods achieved the required accuracy of < 5 mm for TMS treatment. For smaller head rotations of 10°, only the marker-based (a) and markerless method (c) delivered sufficient accuracy for TMS treatment. For larger head rotations of 30°, only the marker-based method (a) achieved sufficient accuracy. While the markerless method (c) did not provide sufficient accuracy for TMS at the larger head rotations, it offers significant advantages such as occlusion-handling and stability and could potentially meet the accuracy requirements with further methodological refinements. © 2020 SPIE.

AB  - Robotic-assisted Transcranial magnetic stimulation has been technically developed and widely used to enhance the long-term outcome of brain stimulation. In this paper, the overall dynamic model of the robotic Transcranial stimulation has been successfully analysed; nevertheless, its parameter estimation leads to a significant challenge due to the complicated dynamic nature of the system. To solve this limitation, system identification based on auto-regressive moving average with an exogenous signal model was consequently implemented. The predicted model was carried out and shown to be an effective data matching with the best-fit percentage of 97.10 %. The optimized gains of proportional and integral control were simulatively achieved using Ziegler-Nichols tuning method incorporated with the transfer function of the proposed dynamic model. These algorithm variables were subsequently used in the robotic implicit force control to regulate the contact forces, in which the human's head is tracked by a 3D scanner in real-time. The results demonstrate significant satisfaction with the overall qualitative performance of the robotic control, and it simplifies effective tracking of the contact force target by indicating closely the desired input with root mean square error of 0.014 N. Hence, it can be concluded that the implicit force control associated with the human's head detection system, is considered acceptable for the effective Transcranial magnetic stimulation to facilitate safe and reliable physical collaboration between the human and robot. © 2020 Zibeline International Publishing Sdn.

AB  - Background: Thigh muscle weakness after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) can persist after returning to activity. While resistance training can improve muscle function, “nonfunctional” training methods are not optimal for inducing transfer of benefits to activities such as walking. Here, we tested the feasibility of a novel functional resistance training (FRT) approach to restore strength and function in an individual with ACLR. Hypothesis: FRT would improve knee strength and function after ACLR. Study Design: Case report. Level of Evidence: Level 5. Methods: A 15-year-old male patient volunteered for an 8-week intervention where he performed 30 minutes of treadmill walking, 3 times per week, while wearing a custom-designed knee brace that provided resistance to the thigh muscles of his ACLR leg. Thigh strength, gait mechanics, and corticospinal and spinal excitability were assessed before and immediately after the 8-week intervention. Voluntary muscle activation was evaluated immediately after the intervention. Results: Knee extensor and flexor strength increased in the ACLR leg from pre- to posttraining (130 to 225 N·m [+74%] and 44 to 88 N·m [+99%], respectively) and increases in between-limb extensor and flexor strength symmetry (45% to 92% [+74%] and 47% to 72% [+65%], respectively) were also noted. After the intervention, voluntary muscle activation in the ACLR leg was 72%, compared with the non-ACLR leg at 75%. Knee angle and moment during late stance phase decreased (ie, improved) in the ACLR leg and appeared more similar to the non-ACLR leg after FRT training (18° to 14° [−23.4] and 0.07 to −0.02 N·m·kg−1·m−1 [−122.8%], respectively). Corticospinal and spinal excitability in the ACLR leg decreased (3511 to 2511 [−28.5%] and 0.42 to 0.24 [−43.7%], respectively) from pre- to posttraining. Conclusion: A full 8 weeks of FRT that targeted both quadriceps and hamstring muscles lead to improvements in strength and gait, suggesting that FRT may constitute a promising and practical alternative to traditional methods of resistance training. Clinical Relevance: FRT may serve as a viable approach to improve knee strength and function after ACL reconstruction. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: This article presents the development and validation of a new robotic system for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), characterized by a new control approach, and an ad-hoc calibration methodology, specifically devised for the TMS application. Methods: The robotic TMS platform is composed of a 7 dof manipulator, controlled by an impedance control, and a camera-based neuronavigation system. The proposed calibration method was optimized on the workspace useful for the specific TMS application (spherical shell around the subject's head), and tested on three different hand-eye and robot-world calibration algorithms. The platform functionality was tested on six healthy subjects during a real TMS procedure, over the left primary motor cortex. Results: employing our method significantly decreases (p< 0.001) the calibration error by 34% for the position and 19% for the orientation. The robotic TMS platform achieved greater orientation accuracy than the expert operators, significantly reducing orientation errors by 46% (p< 0.001). No significant differences were found in the position errors and in the amplitude of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) between the robot-aided TMS and the expert operators. Conclusion: The proposed calibration represents a valid method to significantly reduce the calibration errors in robot-aided TMS applications. Results showed the efficacy of the proposed platform (including the control algorithm) in administering a real TMS procedure, achieving better coil positioning than expert operators, and similar results in terms of MEPs. Significance: This article spotlights how to improve the performance of a robotic TMS platform, providing a reproducible and low-cost alternative to the few devices commercially available. © 1964-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Background: In this study, a novel electromechanical robotic exoskeleton was developed for the rehabilitation of distal joints. The objective was to explore the functional MRI and the neurophysiological changes in cortical-excitability in response to exoskeleton training for a 9-year chronic stroke patient. Case-Report: The study involved a 52-year old female patient with a 9-year chronic stroke of the right hemisphere, who underwent 20 therapy sessions of 45 min each. Cortical-excitability and clinical-scales: Fugl-Mayer (FM), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Brunnstrom-Stage (BS), Barthel-Index (BI), Range of Motion (ROM), were assessed pre-and post-therapy to quantitatively assess the motor recovery. Clinical Rehabilitation Impact: Increase in FM wrist/hand by 6, BI by 10, and decrease in MAS by 1 were reported. Ipsilesional Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) (obtained using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) was increased by 98 μV with a decrease in RMT by 6% and contralesional MEP was increased by 43 μV with a decrease in RMT by 4%. Laterality Index of Sensorimotor Cortex (SMC) reduced in precentral- gyrus (from 0.152 to −0.707) and in postcentral-gyrus (from 0.203 to −0.632). Conclusion: The novel exoskeleton-based training showed improved motor outcomes, cortical excitability, and neuronal activation. The research encourages the further investigation of the potential of exoskeleton training. © Copyright © 2021 Singh, Saini, Kumar, Srivastava, Kumaran and Mehndiratta.

AB  - Introduction: Innovative motor therapies have attempted to reduce upper extremity impairment after stroke but have not made substantial improvement as over 50% of people post-stroke continue to have sensorimotor deficits affecting their self-care and participation in daily activities. Intervention studies have focused on the role of increased dosing, however recent studies have indicated that timing of rehabilitation interventions may be as important as dosing and importantly, that dosing and timing interact in mediating effectiveness. This study is designed to empirically test dosing and timing. Methods and Analysis: In this single-blinded, interventional study, subjects will be stratified on two dimensions, impairment level (Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment (FM) and presence or absence of Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) as follows; (1) Severe, FM score 10–19, MEP+, (2) Severe, FM score 10–19, MEP–, (3) Moderate, FM score 20–49, MEP+, (4) Moderate, FM score 20–49, MEP–. Subjects not eligible for TMS will be assigned to either group 2 (if severe) or group 3 (if moderate). Stratified block randomization will then be used to achieve a balanced assignment. Early Robotic/VR Therapy (EVR) experimental group will receive in-patient usual care therapy plus an extra 10 h of intensive upper extremity therapy focusing on the hand using robotically facilitated rehabilitation interventions presented in virtual environments and initiated 5–30 days post-stroke. Delayed Robotic/VR Therapy (DVR) experimental group will receive the same intervention but initiated 30–60 days post-stroke. Dose-matched usual care group (DMUC) will receive an extra 10 h of usual care initiated 5–30 days post-stroke. Usual Care Group (UC) will receive the usual amount of physical/occupational therapy. Outcomes: There are clinical, neurophysiological, and kinematic/kinetic measures, plus measures of daily arm use and quality of life. Primary outcome is the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) measured at 4 months post-stroke. Discussion: Outcome measures will be assessed to determine whether there is an early time period in which rehabilitation will be most effective, and whether there is a difference in the recapture of premorbid patterns of movement vs. the development of an efficient, but compensatory movement strategy. Ethical Considerations: The IRBs of New Jersey Institute of Technology, Rutgers University, Northeastern University, and Kessler Foundation reviewed and approved all study protocols. Study was registered in https://ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03569059) prior to recruitment. Dissemination will include submission to peer-reviewed journals and professional presentations. © Copyright © 2020 Merians, Fluet, Qiu, Yarossi, Patel, Mont, Saleh, Nolan, Barrett, Tunik and Adamovich.

AB  - Background: Robot-assisted therapy and noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) are promising strategies for stroke rehabilitation. Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the evidence of NIBS as an add-on intervention to robotic therapy in order to improve outcomes of upper-limb motor impairment or activity in individuals with stroke. Methods: This study was performed according to the PRISMA Protocol and was previously registered on the PROSPERO Platform (CRD42017054563). Seven databases and gray literature were systematically searched by 2 reviewers, and 1176 registers were accessed. Eight randomized clinical trials with upper-limb body structure/function or activity limitation outcome measures were included. Subgroup analyses were performed according to phase poststroke, device characteristics (ie, arm support, joints involved, unimanual or bimanual training), NIBS paradigm, timing of stimulation, and number of sessions. The Grade-Pro Software was used to assess quality of the evidence. Results: A nonsignificant homogeneous summary effect size was found both for body structure function domain (mean difference [MD] = 0.15; 95% CI = −3.10 to 3.40; P = 0.93; I2 = 0%) and activity limitation domain (standard MD = 0.03; 95% CI = −0.28 to 0.33; P = 0.87; I2 = 0%). Conclusions: According to this systematic review and meta-analysis, at the moment, there are not enough data about the benefits of NIBS as an add-on intervention to robot-assisted therapy on upper-limb motor function or activity in individuals with stroke. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Building models that are both interpretable and accurate is an unresolved challenge for many pattern recognition problems. In general, rule-based and linear models lack accuracy, while deep learning interpretability is based on rough approximations of the underlying inference. However, recently, the rule-based Tsetlin Machines (TMs) have obtained competitive performance in terms of accuracy, memory footprint, and inference speed on diverse benchmarks (image classification, regression, natural language understanding, and game-playing). TMs construct rules using human-interpretable conjunctive clauses in propositional logic. These, in turn, are combined linearly to solve complex pattern recognition tasks. This paper addresses the accuracy-interpretability challenge in machine learning by introducing a TM with integer weighted clauses - the Integer Weighted TM (IWTM). The intent is to increase TM interpretability by reducing the number of clauses required for competitive performance. The IWTM achieves this by weighting the clauses so that a single clause can replace multiple duplicates. Since each TM clause is formed adaptively by a Tsetlin Automata (TA) team, identifying effective weights becomes a challenging online learning problem. We solve this problem by extending each team of TA with another kind of automaton: the stochastic searching on the line (SSL) automaton. We evaluate the performance of the new scheme empirically using five datasets, along with a study of interpretability. On average, IWTM uses 6.5 times fewer literals than the vanilla TM and 120 times fewer literals than a TM with real-valued weights. Furthermore, in terms of average memory usage and F1-Score, IWTM outperforms simple Multi-Layered Artificial Neural Networks, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost), Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs), as well as the standard and real-value weighted TMs. IWTM finally outperforms Neural Additive Models on Fraud Detection and StructureBoost on CA-58 in terms of Area Under Curve, while performing competitively on COMPAS.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, affecting ambulation even in people with only mild neurological signs. Patients with MS frequently experience spasticity, which contributes significantly to impair their motor functions, including ambulation, owing to muscle stiffness, spasms, and pain. Objectives: To clarify the role of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol(THC):cannabidiol(CBD) oromucosal spray, coupled to robot-aided gait training (RAGT) using the Lokomat©Pro to improve functional ambulation in patients with MS. Methods: We compared 20 patients with MS, who were treated with THC:CBD oromucosal spray in add-on to the ongoing oral antispastic therapy (OAT) (group A), with 20 individuals with MS (matched for clinical-demographic characteristics) who were treated only with OAT (group B). Both the groups underwent RAGT using the Lokomat-Pro (three 45-minute sessions per week). Our primary outcome measures were the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and the 10 meters walking test (10MWT). As secondary outcome measures we evaluated the brain cortical excitability by using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Both parameters were taken before and after the end of the RAGT. Results: FIM improved in group A more than in group B (p<0.001). Moreover, 10MWT decreased in group A more than in group B (p<0.001). These clinical findings were paralleled by a more evident reshape of intracortical excitability in both upper and lower limbs, as suggested by motor evoked potential amplitude increase (p<0.001), intracortical inhibition strengthening (p<0.001), and intracortical facilitation decrease (p=0.01) in group A as compared to group B. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the combined THC:CBD-RAGT approach could be useful in improving gait performance in patients with MS. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Industry 4.0 aims to leverage the connected capabilities and intelligence of distributed socio-technical systems including people, computer-aided design and engineering tools, information systems and sensor networks, robotics, and advanced manufacturing, etc. to improve productivity, quality, flexibility, safety and sustainability across manufacturing enterprises and production environments. Building on this approach, there is also a greater promise of transformation in other industries such as construction and shipbuilding which have traditionally been laggards in direct digital manufacturing. Nonetheless, in order to be able to leverage the connected intelligence of the socio-technical network, we need corresponding tools and methods for Socio-Technical Network Analysis (STNA) and facilitate coordination and transaction of data, information, and knowledge between the distributed systems. This paper discusses the steps towards a framework for STNA in a connected design and manufacturing environment, especially focusing on assessment of transaction of data, information, and knowledge between the constituents of the distributed system. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Background. Upper-limb impairment in patients with chronic stroke appears to be partly attributable to an upregulated reticulospinal tract (RST). Here, we assessed whether the impact of corticospinal (CST) and RST connectivity on motor impairment and skill-acquisition differs in sub-acute stroke, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)–based proxy measures. Methods. Thirty-eight stroke survivors were randomized to either reach training 3-6 weeks post-stroke (plus usual care) or usual care only. At 3, 6 and 12 weeks post-stroke, we measured ipsilesional and contralesional cortical connectivity (surrogates for CST and RST connectivity, respectively) to weak pre-activated triceps and deltoid muscles with single pulse TMS, accuracy of planar reaching movements, muscle strength (Motricity Index) and synergies (Fugl-Meyer upper-limb score). Results. Strength and presence of synergies were associated with ipsilesional (CST) connectivity to the paretic upper-limb at 3 and 12 weeks. Training led to planar reaching skill beyond that expected from spontaneous recovery and occurred for both weak and strong ipsilesional tract integrity. Reaching ability, presence of synergies, skill-acquisition and strength were not affected by either the presence or absence of contralesional (RST) connectivity. Conclusion. The degree of ipsilesional CST connectivity is the main determinant of proximal dexterity, upper-limb strength and synergy expression in sub-acute stroke. In contrast, there is no evidence for enhanced contralesional RST connectivity contributing to any of these components of impairment. In the sub-acute post-stroke period, the balance of activity between CST and RST may matter more for the paretic phenotype than RST upregulation per se. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - There are now a large number of technological and methodological approaches to the rehabilitation of motor function after stroke. It is important to employ these approaches in a manner that is tailored to specific patient impairments and desired functional outcomes, while avoiding the hype of overly broad or unsubstantiated claims for efficacy. Here we review the evidence for poststroke plasticity, including therapy-related plasticity and functional imaging data. Early demonstrations of remapping in somatomotor and somatosensory representations have been succeeded by findings of white matter plasticity and a focus on activity-dependent changes in neuronal properties and connections. The methods employed in neurorehabilitation have their roots in early understanding of neuronal circuitry and plasticity, and therapies involving large numbers of repetitions, such as robotic therapy and constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), change measurable nervous systems properties. Other methods that involve stimulation of brain and peripheral excitable structures have the potential to harness neuroplastic mechanisms, but remain experimental. Gaps in our understanding of the neural substrates targeted by neurorehabilitation technology and techniques remain, preventing their prescriptive application in individual patients as well as their general refinement. However, with ongoing research-facilitated in part by technologies that can capture quantitative information about motor performance-This gap is narrowing. These research approaches can improve efforts to attain the shared goal of better functional recovery after stroke. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Conventional transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) may improve motor learning in children. Mechanisms are not understood. Neuronavigated robotic transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can produce individualised maps of primary motor cortex (M1) topography. We aimed to determine the effects of tDCS- and HD-tDCS-enhanced motor learning on motor maps. Methods: Typically developing children aged 12–18 years were randomised to right M1 anodal tDCS, HD-tDCS, or Sham during training of their left-hand on the Purdue Pegboard Task (PPT) over 5 days. Bilateral motor mapping was performed at baseline (pre), day 5 (post), and 6-weeks retention time (RT). Primary muscle was the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) with secondary muscles of abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and adductor digiti minimi (ADM). Primary mapping outcomes were volume (mm2/mV) and area (mm2). Secondary outcomes were centre of gravity (COG, mm) and hotspot magnitude (mV). Linear mixed-effects modelling was employed to investigate effects of time and stimulation type (tDCS, HD-tDCS, Sham) on motor map characteristics. Results: Twenty-four right-handed participants (median age 15.5 years, 52% female) completed the study with no serious adverse events or dropouts. Quality maps could not be obtained in two participants. No effect of time or group were observed on map area or volume. LFDI COG (mm) differed in the medial-lateral plane (x-axis) between tDCS and Sham (p = 0.038) from pre-to-post mapping sessions. Shifts in map COG were also observed for secondary left-hand muscles. Map metrics did not correlate with behavioural changes. Conclusion: Robotic TMS mapping can safely assess motor cortex neurophysiology in children undergoing motor learning and neuromodulation interventions. Large effects on map area and volume were not observed while changes in COG may occur. Larger controlled studies are required to understand the role of motor maps in interventional neuroplasticity in children. © Copyright © 2021 Giuffre, Zewdie, Wrightson, Cole, Carlson, Kuo, Babwani and Kirton.

AB  - Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been proven to be useful for stroke rehabilitation, but there are a number of factors that impede the use of this technology in rehabilitation clinics and in home-use, the major factors including the usability and costs of the BCI system. The aims of this study were to develop a cheap 3D-printed wrist exoskeleton that can be controlled by a cheap open source BCI (OpenViBE), and to determine if training with such a setup could induce neural plasticity. Eleven healthy volunteers imagined wrist extensions, which were detected from single-trial electroencephalography (EEG), and in response to this, the wrist exoskeleton replicated the intended movement. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited using transcranial magnetic stimulation were measured before, immediately after, and 30 min after BCI training with the exoskeleton. The BCI system had a true positive rate of 86 ± 12% with 1.20 ± 0.57 false detections per minute. Compared to the measurement before the BCI training, the MEPs increased by 35 ± 60% immediately after and 67 ± 60% 30 min after the BCI training. There was no association between the BCI performance and the induction of plasticity. In conclusion, it is possible to detect imaginary movements using an open-source BCI setup and control a cheap 3D-printed exoskeleton that when combined with the BCI can induce neural plasticity. These findings may promote the availability of BCI technology for rehabilitation clinics and home-use. However, the usability must be improved, and further tests are needed with stroke patients. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Robotic devices have been used to rehabilitate walking function after stroke. Although results suggest that post-stroke patients benefit from this non-conventional therapy, there is no agreement on the optimal robot-assisted approaches to promote neurorecovery. Here we present a new robotic therapy protocol using a grounded exoskeleton perturbing the ankle joint based on tacit learning control. Method: Ten healthy individuals and a post-stroke patient participated in the study and were enrolled in a pilot intervention protocol that involved performance of ankle movements following different trajectories via video game visual feedback. The system autonomously modulated task difficulty according to the performance to increase the challenge. We hypothesized that motor learning throughout training sessions would lead to increased corticospinal excitability of dorsi-plantarflexor muscles. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation was used to assess the effects on corticospinal excitability. Results: Improvements have been observed on task performance and motor outcomes in both healthy individuals and post-stroke patient case study. Tibialis Anterior corticospinal excitability increased significantly after the training; however no significant changes were observed on Soleus corticospinal excitability. Clinical scales showed functional improvements in the stroke patient. Discussion and Significance: Our findings both in neurophysiological and performance assessment suggest improved motor learning. Some limitations of the study include treatment duration and intensity, as well as the non-significant changes in corticospinal excitability obtained for Soleus. Nonetheless, results suggest that this robotic training framework is a potentially interesting approach that can be explored for gait rehabilitation in post-stroke patients. © Copyright © 2020 Asín-Prieto, Martínez-Expósito, Barroso, Urendes, Gonzalez-Vargas, Alnajjar, González-Alted, Shimoda, Pons and Moreno.

AB  - Study Design.A systematic review and meta-analysis.Objective.This study was performed to evaluate the effects of different rehabilitation interventions in spinal cord injury.Summary of Background Data.Several activity-based interventions have been widely applied in spinal cord injury in the past, but the effects of these rehabilitation exercises are controversial.Methods.Publications were searched from databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, the database of the U.S. National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) using the searching terms like spinal cord injury, transcranial magnetic stimulation, functional electrical stimulation, activity-based therapy, and robotic-assisted locomotor training. Randomized controlled trials and controlled trials were included. The primary outcomes included functional upper/lower extremity independence, walking capacity, spasticity, and life quality of individuals with spinal cord injury. Meta-analysis was performed using Revman 5.0 software.Results.Thirty-one articles were included. Meta-analysis showed that transcranial magnetic stimulation improved walking speed (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01, 0.16) and lower extremity function (95% CI 1.55, 7.27); functional electrical stimulation significantly increased upper extremity independence (95% CI 0.37, 5.48). Robotic-assisted treadmill training improved lower extremity function (95% CI 3.44, 6.56) compared with related controls.Conclusion.Activity-based intervention like transcranial magnetic stimulation, functional electrical stimulation, and robotic-assisted treadmill training are effective in improving function in individuals with spinal cord injury.Level of Evidence: 1. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Disorders of Consciousness are a big challenge for the entire process of rehabilitation: assessment, diagnosis, pharmacological, and rehabilitation programs, including conventional treatments and the use of new technologies. Causes of Disorders of Consciousness may vary from stroke to traumatic brain injury to post-anoxic or metabolic brain damage; but all Disorders of Consciousness are in fact a wide spectrum of clinical syndromes from vegetative state (recently named unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) to minimally conscious state and they may be a transitory event as well as persistent conditions. The most correct diagnosis possible is important for prognosis, adequate, and tailored rehabilitation planning. We primarily consider the current available evidences on behavioral scales for the assessment of clinical presentation of Disorders of Consciousness because they still are the most important step in diagnosis of Disorders of Consciousness; then we describe the evidences on instrumental means for diagnosis, from EEG to fMRI and ERP. The second part of the chapter is focused on recent rehabilitation evidences and recommendation on therapeutic interventions from early rehabilitation treatments to specific treatments for spasticity or to the use of new technologies such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and robotic devices. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Introduction Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), delivered to the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1), appears to enhance the brain's response to rehabilitative training in patients with stroke. However, its clinical utility is highly subject to variability in different protocols. New evidence has reported that preceding iTBS, with continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) may stabilise and even boost the facilitatory effect of iTBS on the stimulated M1, via metaplasticity. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of iTBS primed with cTBS (ie, priming iTBS), in addition to robot-assisted training (RAT), on the improvement of the hemiparetic upper limb functions of stroke patients and to explore potential sensorimotor neuroplasticity using electroencephalography (EEG). Methods and analysis A three-arm, subjects and assessors-blinded, randomised controlled trial will be performed with patients with chronic stroke. An estimated sample of 36 patients will be needed based on the prior sample size calculation. All participants will be randomly allocated to receive 10 sessions of rTMS with different TBS protocols (cTBS+iTBS, sham cTBS+iTBS and sham cTBS+sham iTBS), three to five sessions per week, for 2-3 weeks. All participants will receive 60 min of RAT after each stimulation session. Primary outcomes will be assessed using Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity scores and Action Research Arm Test. Secondary outcomes will be assessed using kinematic outcomes generated during RAT and EEG. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from The Human Subjects Ethics Sub-committee, University Research Committee of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (reference number: HSEARS20190718003). The results yielded from this study will be presented at international conferences and sent to a peer-review journal to be considered for publication.

AB  - This article is based on a consensus conference, promoted and supported by the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN), which took place in Siena (Italy) in October 2018. The meeting intended to update the ten-year-old safety guidelines for the application of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in research and clinical settings (Rossi et al., 2009). Therefore, only emerging and new issues are covered in detail, leaving still valid the 2009 recommendations regarding the description of conventional or patterned TMS protocols, the screening of subjects/patients, the need of neurophysiological monitoring for new protocols, the utilization of reference thresholds of stimulation, the managing of seizures and the list of minor side effects. New issues discussed in detail from the meeting up to April 2020 are safety issues of recently developed stimulation devices and pulse configurations; duties and responsibility of device makers; novel scenarios of TMS applications such as in the neuroimaging context or imaging-guided and robot-guided TMS; TMS interleaved with transcranial electrical stimulation; safety during paired associative stimulation interventions; and risks of using TMS to induce therapeutic seizures (magnetic seizure therapy). An update on the possible induction of seizures, theoretically the most serious risk of TMS, is provided. It has become apparent that such a risk is low, even in patients taking drugs acting on the central nervous system, at least with the use of traditional stimulation parameters and focal coils for which large data sets are available. Finally, new operational guidelines are provided for safety in planning future trials based on traditional and patterned TMS protocols, as well as a summary of the minimal training requirements for operators, and a note on ethics of neuroenhancement. © 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology

AB  - In real life, the increased data accessing speed and data storage ability is required by most of the machinery fields. However, the real-world problems can be studied effectively with the combination of scientific computational techniques with the mathematical models. Automata theory is known to be the popular mathematical model. Towards most of the software and hardware related applications, the computational methods are analyzed and designed using significant automata theory concepts (likely, pushdown automata (PDA), Turing machines (TMs) and finite automata (FA)). Hence, the conventional lecture-driven style has attracted the reflective preferences of learners using these abstract natured concepts. But the lecture-driven teaching style has less motivated the computer engineering learners. In order to learn automata theory and computational models, we introduce the PDA and TM in a virtual platform. However, this work has motivated the improvement of longitudinal experimental validation and learning using the modern technology. Java Formal Languages and Automata Package (JFLAP) tool is used to write our simulators in JAVA language and the results are obtained from each machine through simulating the input strings. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Aim: To explore the feasibility and possible effects of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered to the supplementary motor area (SMA) on tic severity and motor system neurophysiology in children with Tourette syndrome. Method: Ten children with Tourette syndrome (eight males, two females; 9–15y) participated in this open-label, phase 1 clinical trial. Treatment consisted of 1800 low-frequency (1Hz) neuronavigated robotic rTMS (100% resting motor threshold) to the SMA, bilaterally for 15 sessions. The primary outcome was a change in Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) total score from baseline to posttreatment. Secondary outcome measures included changes in magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolite concentrations, TMS neurophysiology measures, TMS motor maps, and clinical assessments (anxiety, depression) from baseline to the end of treatment. Results: The YGTSS score decreased from baseline after treatment (p<0.001; Cohen's d=2.9). All procedures were well-tolerated. Interpretation: Robot-driven, neuronavigated bilateral rTMS of the SMA is feasible in children with Tourette syndrome and appears to reduce tic severity. What this paper adds Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is feasible to use in children with Tourette syndrome. rTMS is tolerated by children with Tourette syndrome. Precise targeting of the supplementary motor area using functional magnetic resonance imaging is also feasible in these children. © 2021 Mac Keith Press
