AB  - For physiological brain function a particular balance between excitation and inhibition is essential. Paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can estimate cortical excitability and the relative contribution of inhibitory and excitatory networks. Combining TMS with electroencephalography (EEG) enables additional assessment of the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal responses in the stimulated brain. This study aims to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics and stability of single and paired pulse TMS-EEG responses, and assess long intracortical inhibition (LICI) at the cortical level. Twenty-five healthy subjects were studied twice, approximately one week apart. Manual coil positioning was applied in sixteen subjects and robot-guided positioning in nine. Both motor cortices were stimulated with 50 single pulses and 50 paired pulses at each of the five interstimulus intervals (ISIs): 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 ms. To assess stability and LICI, the intraclass correlation coefficient and cluster-based permutation analysis were used. We found great resemblance in the topographical distribution of the characteristic TMS-EEG components for single and paired pulse TMS. Stimulation of the dominant and non-dominant hemisphere resulted in a mirrored spatiotemporal dynamics. No significant effect on the TMS-EEG responses was found for either stimulated hemisphere, time or coil positioning method, indicating the stability of both single and paired pulse TMS-EEG responses. For all ISIs, LICI was characterized by significant suppression of the late N100 and P180 components in the central areas, without affecting the early P30, N45 and P60 components. These observations in healthy subjects can serve as reference values for future neuropsychiatric and pharmacological studies.

AB  - A vision-based head tracking method for robotic transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), requiring no attachments to patient, is proposed to track the movements of patient's head during treatment. First, a facial landmark detection method based on Constrained Local Neural Field (CLNF) algorithm is used. Second, a method of head location and pose estimation is presented and a filter for image restoration is used for a higher accuracy. Finally, calibration approaches are proposed based on the coordinates of the robot arm and camera and real-time motion tracking system. Experiment results indicate that the accuracy and real-time performance of this head tracking method satisfy the requirements of TMS treatment.

AB  - Robotic transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive and safe tool that produces cortical motor maps using neuronavigational and neuroanatomical images. Motor maps are individualized representations of the primary motor cortex (M1) topography that may reflect developmental and interventional plasticity. Results of TMS motor map reliability testing have been variable, and robotic measures are undefined. We aimed to determine the short- and long-term reliability of robotic TMS motor maps. Twenty healthy participants underwent motor mapping at baseline, 24 h, and 4 wk. A 12 x 12 grid (7-mm spacing) was placed over the left M1, centered over the hand knob area. Four suprathreshold stimulations were delivered at each grid point. First dorsal interosseous (FDI) motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were analyzed offline to generate map characteristics of area, volume, center of gravity (COG), and hotspot magnitude. Subsets of each outcome corresponding to 75%, 50%, and 25% of each map were determined. Reliability measures including intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), minimal detectable change (MDC), and standard error of measure (SEM) were calculated. Map volume, COG, and hotspot magnitude were the most reliable measures (good-to-excellent) over both short- and long-term sessions. Map area reliability was poor-to-moderate for short- and long-term sessions. Smaller map percentile subsets showed decreased variability but only minimal improvements in reliability. MDC for most outcomes was >50%. Procedures were well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Robotic TMS motor mapping is relatively reliable over time, but careful consideration of specific outcomes is required for this method to interrogate plasticity in the human motor system.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Robotic transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive and safe tool that produces cortical motor maps-individualized representations of the primary motor cortex (M1) topography-that may reflect developmental and interventional plasticity. This study is the first to evaluate short- and long-term relative and absolute reliability of TMS mapping outcomes at various M1 excitability levels using novel robotic neuronavigated TMS.

AB  - Previous research has suggested that the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) is involved with visual decision making, and specifically with the accumulation of information leading to a decision. In humans, this research has been primarily based on imaging and electroencephalography (EEG), and as such only correlational. One line of such research has led to a model of three spatially distributed brain networks that activate in temporal sequence to enable visual decision-making. The model predicted that disturbing neural processing in the LOC at a specific latency would slow object decision-making, increasing reaction time (RT) in a difficult discrimination task. We utilized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test this prediction, perturbing LOC beginning at 400 ms post-stimulus onset, a time in the model corresponding to LOC activation at a particular difficulty level, with the expectation of increased RT. Thirteen healthy adults participated in two TMS sessions in which left and right LOC were stimulated separately utilizing neuronavigation and robotic coil guidance. Participants performed a two-alternative forced-choice task selecting whether a car or face was present on each trial amidst visual noise pre-tested to approximate a 75% accuracy level. In an effort to disrupt processing, pairs of TMS pulses separated by 50 ms were presented at one of five stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs): -200, 200, 400, 450, or 500 ms. Behavioral performance differed systematically across SOAs for RT and accuracy measures. As predicted, TMS at 400 ms resulted in a significant slowing of RT. TMS delivered at -200 ms resulted in faster RT, indicating early stimulation may result in priming and performance enhancement. Use of TMS thus causally demonstrated the involvement of LOC in this task, and more broadly with perceptual decision-making; additionally, it demonstrated the role of TMS in testing well-developed neural models of perceptual processing.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) motor mapping is a safe, non-invasive method used to study corticomotor organization and intervention-induced plasticity. Reliability of resting maps is well established, but understudied for active maps and unestablished for active maps obtained using robotic TMS techniques. The objective of this study was to determine the reliability of robotic neuro-navigated TMS motor map measures during active muscle contraction. We hypothesized that map area and volume would show excellent short- and medium-term reliability. Twenty healthy adults were tested on 3 days. Active maps of the first dorsal interosseous muscle were created using a 12 x 12 grid (7 mm spacing). Short- (24 h) and medium-term (3-5 weeks) relative (intra-class correlation coefficient) and absolute (minimal detectable change (MDC); standard error of measure) reliabilities were evaluated for map area, volume, center of gravity (CoG), and hotspot magnitude (peak-to-peak MEP amplitude at the hotspot), along with active motor threshold (AMT) and maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). This study found that AMT and MVC had good-to-excellent short- and medium-term reliability. Map CoG (x and y) were the most reliable map measures across sessions with excellent short- and medium-term reliability (p < 0.001). Map area, hotspot magnitude, and map volume followed with better reliability medium-term than short-term, with a change of 28%, 62%, and 78% needed to detect a true medium-term change, respectively. Therefore, robot-guided neuro-navigated TMS active mapping is relatively reliable but varies across measures. This, and MDC, should be considered in interventional study designs.

AB  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) can be used to map cortical motor topography by spatially sampling the sensorimotor cortex while recording Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP) with surface electromyography (EMG). Traditional sampling strategies are time-consuming and inefficient, as they ignore the fact that responsive sites are typically sparse and highly spatially correlated. An alternative approach, commonly employed when TMS mapping is used for presurgical planning, is to leverage the expertise of the coil operator to use MEPs elicited by previous stimuli as feedback to decide which loci to stimulate next. In this paper, we propose to automatically infer optimal future stimulus loci using active learning Gaussian Process-based sampling in place of user expertise. We first compare the user-guided (USRG) method to the traditional grid selection method and randomized sampling to verify that the USRG approach has superior performance. We then compare several novel active Gaussian Process (GP) strategies with the USRG approach. Experimental results using real data show that, as expected, the USRG method is superior to the grid and random approach in both time efficiency and MEP map accuracy. We also found that an active warped GP entropy and a GP random-based strategy performed equally as well as, or even better than, the USRG method. These methods were completely automatic, and succeeded in efficiently sampling the regions in which the MEP response variations are largely confined. This work provides the foundation for highly efficient, fully automatized TMS mapping, especially when considered in the context of advances in robotic coil operation.

AB  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a neurostimulation technique based on the principle of electromagnetic induction of an electric field in the brain with both research and clinical applications. To produce an optimal neuro-modulatory effect, TMS coil must be placed on the head and oriented accurately with respect to the region of interest within the brain. A robotic method can enhance the accuracy and facilitate the procedure for TMS coil placement. This work presents two system improvements for robot-assisted TMS (RA-TMS) application. Previous systems have used outside-in tracking method where a stationary external infrared (IR) tracker is used as a reference point to track the head and TMS coil positions. This method is prone to losing track of the coil or the head if the IR camera is blocked by the robotic arm during its motion. To address this issue, we implemented an inside-out tracking method by mounting a portable IR camera on the robot end-effector. This method guarantees that the line of sight of the IR camera is not obscured by the robotic arm at any time during its motion. We also integrated a portable projection mapping device (PPMD) into the RA-TMS system to provide visual guidance during TMS application. PPMD can track the head via an IR tracker, and can project a planned contact point of TMS coil on the head or overlay the underlying brain anatomy in real-time.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) motor mapping is a safe, non-invasive method that can be used to study corticomotor organization. Motor maps are typically acquired at rest, and comparisons to maps obtained during muscle activation have been both limited and contradictory. Understanding the relationship between functional activation of the corticomotor system as recorded by motor mapping is crucial for their use clinically and in research. The present study utilized robotic TMS paired with personalized neuro-navigation to examine the relationship between resting and active motor map measures and their relationship with motor performance. Twenty healthy right-handed participants underwent resting and active robotic TMS motor mapping of the first dorsal interosseous to 10% maximum voluntary contraction. Motor map parameters including map area, volume, and measures of map centrality were compared between techniques using paired sample tests of difference and Bland-Altman plots and analysis. Map area, volume, and hotspot magnitude were larger in the active motor maps, while map center of gravity and hotspot locations remained consistent between both maps. No associations were observed between motor maps and motor performance as measured by the Purdue Pegboard Test. Our findings support previous suggestions that maps scale with muscle contraction. Differences in mapping outcomes suggest rest and active motor maps may reflect functionally different corticomotor representations. Advanced analysis methods may better characterize the underlying neurophysiology of both types of motor mapping.

AB  - Objective: This article presents the development and validation of a new robotic system for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), characterized by a new control approach, and an ad-hoc calibration methodology, specifically devised for the TMS application. Methods: The robotic TMS platform is composed of a 7 dof manipulator, controlled by an impedance control, and a camera-based neuronavigation system. The proposed calibration method was optimized on the workspace useful for the specific TMS application (spherical shell around the subject's head), and tested on three different hand-eye and robot-world calibration algorithms. The platform functionality was tested on six healthy subjects during a real TMS procedure, over the left primary motor cortex. Results: employing our method significantly decreases (p < 0.001) the calibration error by 34% for the position and 19% for the orientation. The robotic TMS platform achieved greater orientation accuracy than the expert operators, significantly reducing orientation errors by 46% (p < 0.001). No significant differences were found in the position errors and in the amplitude of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) between the robot-aided TMS and the expert operators. Conclusion: The proposed calibration represents a valid method to significantly reduce the calibration errors in robot-aided TMS applications. Results showed the efficacy of the proposed platform (including the control algorithm) in administering a real TMS procedure, achieving better coil positioning than expert operators, and similar results in terms of MEPs. Significance: This article spotlights how to improve the performance of a robotic TMS platform, providing a reproducible and low-cost alternative to the few devices commercially available.

AB  - Introduction: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) motor mapping can characterize the neurophysiology of the motor system. Limitations including human error and the challenges of pediatric populations may be overcome by emerging robotic systems. We aimed to show that neuronavigated robotic motor mapping in adolescents could efficiently produce discrete maps of individual upper extremity muscles, the characteristics of which would correlate with motor behavior.
   Methods: Typically developing adolescents (TDA) underwent neuronavigated robotic TMS mapping of bilateral motor cortex. Representative maps of first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor pollicis brevis (APB), and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles in each hand were created. Map features including area (primary), volume, and center of gravity were analyzed across different excitability regions (R100%, R75%, R50%, R25%). Correlations between map metrics and validated tests of hand motor function (Purdue Pegboard Test as primary) were explored.
   Results: Twenty-four right-handed participants (range 12-18 years, median 15.5 years, 52% female) completed bilateral mapping and motor assessments with no serious adverse events or dropouts. Gender and age were associated with hand function and motor map characteristics. Full motor maps (R100%) for FDI did not correlate with motor function in either hand. Smaller excitability subset regions demonstrated reduced variance and dose-dependent correlations between primary map variables and motor function in the dominant hemisphere.
   Conclusions: Hand function in TDA correlates with smaller subset excitability regions of robotic TMS motor map outcomes. Refined motor maps may have less variance and greater potential to quantify interventional neuroplasticity. Robotic TMS mapping is safe and feasible in adolescents.

AB  - AIM To explore the feasibility and possible effects of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered to the supplementary motor area (SMA) on tic severity and motor system neurophysiology in children with Tourette syndrome.
   METHOD Ten children with Tourette syndrome (eight males, two females; 9-15y) participated in this open-label, phase 1 clinical trial. Treatment consisted of 1800 low-frequency (1Hz) neuronavigated robotic rTMS (100% resting motor threshold) to the SMA, bilaterally for 15 sessions. The primary outcome was a change in Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) total score from baseline to posttreatment. Secondary outcome measures included changes in magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolite concentrations, TMS neurophysiology measures, TMS motor maps, and clinical assessments (anxiety, depression) from baseline to the end of treatment.
   RESULTS The YGTSS score decreased from baseline after treatment (p<0.001; Cohen's d=2.9). All procedures were well-tolerated.
   INTERPRETATION Robot-driven, neuronavigated bilateral rTMS of the SMA is feasible in children with Tourette syndrome and appears to reduce tic severity.

AB  - BackgroundMotor hotspot identification represents the first step in the determination of the motor threshold and is the basis for the specification of stimulation intensity used for various Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) applications. The level of experimenters' experience and the methodology of motor hotspot identification differ between laboratories. The need for an optimized and time-efficient technique for motor hotspot identification is therefore substantial.ObjectiveWith the current work, we present a framework for an optimized and time-efficient semi-automated motor hotspot search (SAMHS) technique utilizing a neuronavigated robot-assisted TMS system (TMS-cobot). Furthermore, we aim to test its practicality and accuracy by a comparison with a manual motor hotspot identification method.MethodA total of 32 participants took part in this dual-center study. At both study centers, participants underwent manual hotspot search (MHS) with an experienced TMS researcher, and the novel SAMHS procedure with a TMS-cobot (hereafter, called cobot hotspot search, CHS) in a randomized order. Resting motor threshold (RMT), and stimulus intensity to produce 1 mV (SI1mV) peak-to-peak of motor-evoked potential (MEP), as well as MEPs with 120% RMT and SI1mV were recorded as outcome measures for comparison.ResultsCompared to the MHS method, the CHS produced lower RMT, lower SI1mV and a trend-wise higher peak-to-peak MEP amplitude in stimulations with SI1mV. The duration of the CHS procedure was longer than that of the MHS (15.60 vs. 2.43 min on average). However, accuracy of the hotspot was higher for the CHS compared to the MHS.ConclusionsThe SAMHS procedure introduces an optimized motor hotspot determination system that is easy to use, and strikes a fairly good balance between accuracy and speed. This new procedure can thus be deplored by experienced as well as beginner-level TMS researchers.

AB  - This article is based on a consensus conference, promoted and supported by the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN), which took place in Siena (Italy) in October 2018. The meeting intended to update the ten-year-old safety guidelines for the application of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in research and clinical settings (Rossi et al., 2009). Therefore, only emerging and new issues are covered in detail, leaving still valid the 2009 recommendations regarding the description of conventional or patterned TMS protocols, the screening of subjects/patients, the need of neurophysiological monitoring for new protocols, the utilization of reference thresholds of stimulation, the managing of seizures and the list of minor side effects.
   New issues discussed in detail from the meeting up to April 2020 are safety issues of recently developed stimulation devices and pulse configurations; duties and responsibility of device makers; novel scenarios of TMS applications such as in the neuroimaging context or imaging-guided and robot-guided TMS; TMS interleaved with transcranial electrical stimulation; safety during paired associative stimulation interventions; and risks of using TMS to induce therapeutic seizures (magnetic seizure therapy).
   An update on the possible induction of seizures, theoretically the most serious risk of TMS, is provided. It has become apparent that such a risk is low, even in patients taking drugs acting on the central nervous system, at least with the use of traditional stimulation parameters and focal coils for which large data sets are available. Finally, new operational guidelines are provided for safety in planning future trials based on traditional and patterned TMS protocols, as well as a summary of the minimal training requirements for operators, and a note on ethics of neuroenhancement.

AB  - A 10-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex has been shown to increase dopaminergic activity in the dorsal striatum, a region strongly implicated in reinforcement learning. However, the behavioural influence of this effect remains largely unknown. We tested the causal effects of 10-Hz stimulation on behavioural and computational characteristics of reinforcement learning. A total of 40 healthy individuals were randomized into active and sham (placebo) stimulation groups. Each participant underwent one stimulation session (1500 pulses) in which stimulation was applied over the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex using a robotic arm. Participants then completed a reinforcement learning task sensitive to striatal dopamine functioning. Participants' choices were modelled using a reinforcement learning model (Q-learning) that calculates separate learning rates associated with positive and negative reward prediction errors. Subjects receiving active stimulation exhibited increased reward rate (number of correct responses per second of task activity) compared with those in sham. Computationally, although no group differences were observed, the active group displayed a higher learning rate for correct trials (alpha G) compared with incorrect trials (alpha L). Finally, when tested with novel pairs of stimuli, the active group displayed extremely fast reaction times, and a trend towards a higher reward rate. This study provided specific behavioural and computational accounts of altered striatal-mediated behaviour, particularly response vigour, induced by a proposed increase of dopamine activity by 10-Hz stimulation to the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. Together, these findings bolster the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to target neurocognitive disturbances attributed to the dysregulation of dopaminergic-striatal circuits.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate neurophysiological alterations within the typical symptomatic period after concussion (1-month) and throughout recovery (6-months) in adolescents; and (2) to examine relationships between neurophysiological and upper limb kinematic outcomes. METHODS: 18 adolescents with concussion were compared to 17 healthy controls. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to assess neurophysiological differences between groups including: short- and long-interval intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation, short- and long-latency afferent inhibition, afferent facilitation, and transcallosal inhibition (TCI). Behavioral measures of upper limb kinematics were assessed with a robotic device. RESULTS: Mixed model analysis of neurophysiological data identified two key findings. First, participants with concussion demonstrated delayed onset of interhemispheric inhibition, as indexed by TCI, compared to healthy controls. Second, our exploratory analysis indicated that the magnitude of TCI onset delay in adolescents with concussion was related to upper limb kinematics. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that concussion in adolescence alters interhemispheric communication. We note relationships between neurophysiological and kinematic data, suggesting an affinity for individuals with less concussion-related physiological change to improve their motor behavior over time. These data serve as an important step in future development of assessments (neurobiological and clinical) and interventions for concussion.

AB  - IntroductionTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) mapping has become a critical tool for exploratory studies of the human corticomotor (M1) organization. Here, we propose to gather existing cutting-edge TMS-EMG and TMS-EEG approaches into a combined multi-dimensional TMS mapping that considers local and whole-brain excitability changes as well as state and time-specific changes in cortical activity. We applied this multi-dimensional TMS mapping approach to patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) ON and OFF. Our goal was to identifying one or several TMS mapping-derived markers that could provide unprecedent new insights onto the mechanisms of DBS in movement disorders. MethodsSix PD patients (1 female, mean age: 62.5 yo [59-65]) implanted with DBS-STN for 1 year, underwent a robotized sulcus-shaped TMS motor mapping to measure changes in muscle-specific corticomotor representations and a movement initiation task to probe state-dependent modulations of corticospinal excitability in the ON (using clinically relevant DBS parameters) and OFF DBS states. Cortical excitability and evoked dynamics of three cortical areas involved in the neural control of voluntary movements (M1, pre-supplementary motor area - preSMA and inferior frontal gyrus - IFG) were then mapped using TMS-EEG coupling in the ON and OFF state. Lastly, we investigated the timing and nature of the STN-to-M1 inputs using a paired pulse DBS-TMS-EEG protocol. ResultsIn our sample of patients, DBS appeared to induce fast within-area somatotopic re-arrangements of motor finger representations in M1, as revealed by mediolateral shifts of corticomuscle representations. STN-DBS improved reaction times while up-regulating corticospinal excitability, especially during endogenous motor preparation. Evoked dynamics revealed marked increases in inhibitory circuits in the IFG and M1 with DBS ON. Finally, inhibitory conditioning effects of STN single pulses on corticomotor activity were found at timings relevant for the activation of inhibitory GABAergic receptors (4 and 20 ms). ConclusionTaken together, these results suggest a predominant role of some markers in explaining beneficial DBS effects, such as a context-dependent modulation of corticospinal excitability and the recruitment of distinct inhibitory circuits, involving long-range projections from higher level motor centers and local GABAergic neuronal populations. These combined measures might help to identify discriminative features of DBS mechanisms towards deep clinical phenotyping of DBS effects in Parkinson's Disease and in other pathological conditions.

AB  - Background: Although much is known about cognitive dysfunction in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), few studies have examined the pathophysiology of disordered motor circuitry. We explored differences in neurometabolite levels and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-derived corticomotor representations among children with ADHD and typically developing children. Methods: We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) protocols to measure excitatory (glutamate + glutamine [Glx]) and inhibitory (gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) neurometabolite levels in the dominant primary motor cortex (M1) and the supplementary motor area (SMA) in children with ADHD and typically developing children. We used robotic neuronavigated TMS to measure corticospinal excitability and create corticomotor maps. Results: We collected data from 26 medication-free children with ADHD (aged 7-16 years) and 25 typically developing children (11-16 years). Children with ADHD had lower M1 Glx (p = 0.044, d = 0.6); their mean resting motor threshold was lower (p = 0.029, d = 0.8); their map area was smaller (p = 0.044, d = 0.7); and their hotspot density was higher (p = 0.008, d = 0.9). M1 GABA levels were associated with motor map area (p = 0.036). Limitations: Some TMS data were lost because the threshold of some children exceeded 100% of the machine output. The relatively large MRS voxel required to obtain sufficient signal-to-noise ratio and reliably measure GABA levels encompassed tissue beyond the M1, making this measure less anatomically specific. Conclusion: The neurochemistry and neurophysiology of key nodes in the motor network may be altered in children with ADHD, and the differences appear to be related to each other. These findings suggest potentially novel neuropharmacological and neuromodulatory targets for ADHD.

AB  - Levodopa-induced dyskinesia gradually emerges during long-term dopamine therapy, causing major disability in patients with Parkinson disease. Using pharmacodynamic functional MRI, we have previously shown that the intake of levodopa triggers an excessive activation of the pre-supplementary motor area in Parkinson disease patients with peak-of-dose dyskinesia. In this pre-registered, interventional study, we tested whether the abnormal responsiveness of the pre-supplementary motor area to levodopa may constitute a 'stimulation target' for treating dyskinesia. A gender-balanced group of 17 Parkinson disease patients with peak-of-dose dyskinesia received 30min of robot-assisted repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, after they had paused their anti-Parkinson medication. Real-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation at 100% or sham-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation at 30% of individual resting corticomotor threshold of left first dorsal interosseous muscle was applied on separate days in counterbalanced order. Following repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, patients took 200mg of oral levodopa and underwent functional MRI to map brain activity, while they performed the same go/no-go task as in our previous study. Blinded video assessment revealed that real-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation delayed the onset of dyskinesia and reduced its severity relative to sham-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Individual improvement in dyskinesia severity scaled linearly with the modulatory effect of real-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on task-related activation in the pre-supplementary motor area. Stimulation-induced delay in dyskinesia onset correlated positively with the induced electrical field strength in the pre-supplementary motor area. Our results provide converging evidence that the levodopa-triggered increase in pre-supplementary motor area activity plays a causal role in the pathophysiology of peak-of-dose dyskinesia and constitutes a promising cortical target for brain stimulation therapy.

AB  - Brain stimulation combined with intensive therapy may improve hand function in children with perinatal stroke-induced unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP). However, response to therapy varies and underlying neuroplasticity mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we aimed to characterize robotic motor mapping outcomes in children with UCP. Twenty-nine children with perinatal stroke and UCP (median age 11 +/- 2 years) were compared to 24 typically developing controls (TDC). Robotic, neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation was employed to define bilateral motor maps including area, volume, and peak motor evoked potential (MEP). Map outcomes were compared to the primary clinical outcome of the Jebsen-Taylor Test of Hand Function (JTT). Maps were reliably obtained in the contralesional motor cortex (24/29) but challenging in the lesioned hemisphere (5/29). Within the contralesional M1 of participants with UCP, area and peak MEP amplitude of the unaffected map were larger than the affected map. When comparing bilateral maps within the contralesional M1 in children with UCP to that of TDC, only peak MEP amplitudes were different, being smaller for the affected hand as compared to TDC. We observed correlations between the unaffected map when stimulating the contralesional M1 and function of the unaffected hand. Robotic motor mapping can characterize motor cortex neurophysiology in children with perinatal stroke. Map area and peak MEP amplitude may represent discrete biomarkers of developmental plasticity in the contralesional M1. Correlations between map metrics and hand function suggest clinical relevance and utility in studies of interventional plasticity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While the facilitatory and inhibitory effects of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) and continuous TBS (cTBS) protocols have been well documented on motor physiology, the action of TBS protocols on prefrontal functioning remain unclear. Here we asked whether iTBS or cTBS can differentially modulate rewardrelated signaling in the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC).
   METHODS: Across 2 experiments, we used a robot-assisted transcranial magnetic stimulation system, combined with electroencephalogram recordings, to investigate the aftereffects of prefrontal iTBS and cTBS on the reward positivity, an electrophysiological signal believed to index sensitivity of the aMCC to rewards. Twenty adults (age, 18-28 years) participated in experiment 1 in which we used a scalp landmark for TBS targeting, and 14 adults (age, 18-28 years) participated in experiment 2, in which we aimed to increase TBS effectiveness by utilizing cortical thickness maps to select individualized dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex targets.
   RESULTS: We demonstrated that prefrontal iTBS suppressed reward-related signaling in the aMCC (reduction in reward positivity) and caused a decrease in postfeedback switch choices. cTBS displayed no effect. We replicated and strengthened this effect on the reward positivity by targeting dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex regions displaying maximal cortical thickness.
   CONCLUSIONS: While these results are inconsistent with reported TBS effects on motor cortex, the present findings offer a novel transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting approach and normative insights into the magnitude and time course of TBS-induced changes in aMCC excitability. By modulating how the aMCC links value to goal-directed behavior, this research opens an exciting new era of investigative possibilities in the understanding of aMCC function and treatment of aMCC dysfunction.

AB  - There has been an increasing demand for robotic coil positioning during repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment. Accurate coil positioning is crucial because rTMS generally targets specific brain regions for both research and clinical application with other reasons such as safety, consistency and reliability and individual variablity. Some previous studies have employed industrial robots or co-robots and showed they can more precisely stimulate the target cortical regions than traditional manual methods. In this study, we not only developed a custom-TMS robot for better TMS coil placement but also analyzed the therapeutic effects on depression. Treatment effects were evaluated by measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using single-photon emission computed tomography and depression severity before and after rTMS for the two positioning methods. The rTMS preparation time with our robotic coil placement was reduced by 53% compared with that of the manual method. The position and orientation errors were also significantly reduced from 11.17 mm and 4.06 degrees to 0.94 mm and 0.11 degrees, respectively, confirming the superiority of robotic positioning. The results from clinical and neuroimaging assessments indicated comparable improvements in depression severity and rCBF in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the robotic and manual rTMS groups. A questionnaire was used to determine the patients' feelings about the robotic system, including the safety and preparation time. A high safety score indicated good acceptability of robotic rTMS at the clinical site.

AB  - The use of TMS-EEG coupling as a neuroimaging tool for the functional exploration of the human brain recently gained strong interest. If this tool directly inherits the fine temporal resolution from EEG, its spatial counterpart remains unknown. In this study, we explored the spatial resolution of TMS-EEG coupling by evaluating the min-imal distance between two stimulated cortical sites that would significantly evoke different response dynamics. TMS evoked responses were mapped on the sensorimotor region in twenty participants. The stimulation grid was composed of nine targets separated between 10 and 15 mm on average. The dynamical signatures of TMS evoked activity were extracted and compared between sites using both local and remote linear regression scores and spatial generalized mixed models. We found a significant effect of the distance between stimulated sites on their dynamical signatures, neighboring sites showing differentiable response dynamics. Besides, common dynamical signatures were also found between sites up to 25-30 mm from each other. This overlap in dynamical properties decreased with distance and was stronger between sites within the same Brodmann area. Our results suggest that the spatial resolution of TMS-EEG coupling might be at least as high as 10 mm. Furthermore, our results reveal an anisotropic spatial resolution that was higher across than within the same Brodmann areas, in accordance with the TMS induced E-field modeling. Common cytoarchitectonic leading to shared dynamical properties within the same Brodmann area could also explain this anisotropy. Overall, these findings suggest that TMS-EEG benefits from the spatial resolution of TMS, which makes it an accurate technique for meso-scale brain mapping.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a powerful and non-invasive technique to stimulate nerve cells in the brain to improve symptoms of depression. It needs accurate contact force and positioning of a stimulating coil to offer effective treatment. Conventionally, a neurologist has to manually place the coil on the patient's head at a predefined position and orientation throughout the 30-to-45-minute treatment. This paper consequently highlights the design of a robot control framework used for the transcranial magnetic stimulation. The hybrid Proportional-Derivative position and Proportional-Integral force control scheme was successfully implemented on the effective robotic system. The system can track the head movement by using the Kinect camera and simultaneously maintain the contact force between the magnetic coil and the head in real-time. The optimal gain tuning technique was adopted. It delivered PD gains of K-p = 75.0, K-d = 2.0 and PI gains of K-p = 0.09 and K-i = 0.011, respectively. This provides a faster response of the robot end-effector with a small interactive force error. The experimental results show that when the head has translational and rotational motions, the robot-assisted transcranial magnetic stimulation control system performs with a safe and reliable manner validated by the quantitative measurement.

AB  - For achieving motor recovery in individuals with sensorimotor deficits, augmented activation of the appropriate sensorimotor system, and facilitated induction of neural plasticity are essential. An emerging procedure that combines peripheral nerve stimulation and its associative stimulation with central brain stimulation is known to enhance the excitability of the motor cortex. In order to effectively apply this paired stimulation technique, timing between central and peripheral stimuli must be individually adjusted. There is a small range of effective timings between two stimuli, or the inter-stimulus interval window (ISI-W). Properties of ISI-W from neuromodulation in response to mechanical stimulation (Mstim) of muscles have been understudied because of the absence of a versatile and reliable mechanical stimulator. This paper adopted a combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and Mstim by using a high-precision robotic mechanical stimulator. A pneumatically operated robotic tendon tapping device was applied. A low-friction linear cylinder achieved high stimulation precision in time and low electromagnetic artifacts in physiological measurements. This paper describes a procedure to effectively estimate an individual ISI-W from the transiently enhanced motor evoked potential (MEP) with a reduced number of paired Mstim and sub-threshold TMS trials by applying statistical sampling and regression technique. This paper applied a total of four parametric and non-parametric statistical regression methods for ISI-W estimation. The developed procedure helps to reduce time for individually adjusting effective ISI, reducing physical burden on the subject.

AB  - Neurorecovery from locomotor training is well established in human spinal cord injury (SCI). However, neurorecovery resulting from combined interventions has not been widely studied. In this randomized clinical trial, we established the tibialis anterior (TA) flexion reflex modulation pattern when transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex was paired with transcutaneous spinal cord (transspinal) stimulation over the thoracolumbar region during assisted step training. Single pulses of TMS were delivered either before (TMS-transspinal) or after (transspinal-TMS) transspinal stimulation during the stance phase of the less impaired leg. Eight individuals with chronic incomplete or complete SCI received at least 20 sessions of paired stimulation during assisted step training. Each session consisted of 240 paired stimuli delivered over 10-min blocks for 1 h during robotic-assisted step training with the Lokomat6 Pro (R). Body weight support, leg guidance force and treadmill speed were adjusted based on each participant's ability to step without knee buckling or toe dragging. Both the early and late TA flexion reflex remained unaltered after TMS-transspinal and locomotor training. In contrast, the early and late TA flexion reflexes were significantly depressed during stepping after transspinal-TMS and locomotor training. Reflex changes occurred at similar slopes and intercepts before and after training. Our findings support that targeted brain and spinal cord stimulation coupled with locomotor training reorganizes the function of flexion reflex pathways, which are a part of locomotor networks, in humans with varying levels of sensorimotor function after SCI.

AB  - Introduction: Conventional transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) may improve motor learning in children. Mechanisms are not understood. Neuronavigated robotic transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can produce individualised maps of primary motor cortex (M1) topography. We aimed to determine the effects of tDCS- and HD-tDCS-enhanced motor learning on motor maps.
   Methods: Typically developing children aged 12-18 years were randomised to right M1 anodal tDCS, HD-tDCS, or Sham during training of their left-hand on the Purdue Pegboard Task (PPT) over 5 days. Bilateral motor mapping was performed at baseline (pre), day 5 (post), and 6-weeks retention time (RT). Primary muscle was the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) with secondary muscles of abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and adductor digiti minimi (ADM). Primary mapping outcomes were volume (mm(2)/mV) and area (mm(2)). Secondary outcomes were centre of gravity (COG, mm) and hotspot magnitude (mV). Linear mixed-effects modelling was employed to investigate effects of time and stimulation type (tDCS, HD-tDCS, Sham) on motor map characteristics.
   Results: Twenty-four right-handed participants (median age 15.5 years, 52% female) completed the study with no serious adverse events or dropouts. Quality maps could not be obtained in two participants. No effect of time or group were observed on map area or volume. LFDI COG (mm) differed in the medial-lateral plane (x-axis) between tDCS and Sham (p = 0.038) from pre-to-post mapping sessions. Shifts in map COG were also observed for secondary left-hand muscles. Map metrics did not correlate with behavioural changes.
   Conclusion: Robotic TMS mapping can safely assess motor cortex neurophysiology in children undergoing motor learning and neuromodulation interventions. Large effects on map area and volume were not observed while changes in COG may occur. Larger controlled studies are required to understand the role of motor maps in interventional neuroplasticity in children.

AB  - The modular organization of the cortex refers to subsets of highly interconnected nodes, sharing specific cytoarchitectural and dynamical properties. These properties condition the level of excitability of local pools of neurons. In this study, we described TMS evoked potentials (TEP) input-output properties to provide new insights into regional cortical excitability. We combined robotized TMS with EEG to disentangle region-specific TEP from threshold to saturation and describe their oscillatory contents. Twenty-two young healthy participants received robotized TMS pulses over the right primary motor cortex (M1), the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the right superior occipital lobe (SOL) at five stimulation intensities (40, 60, 80, 100, and 120% resting motor threshold) and one short-interval intracortical inhibition condition during EEG recordings. Ten additional subjects underwent the same experiment with a realistic sham TMS procedure. The results revealed interregional differences in the TEPs input-output functions as well as in the responses to paired-pulse conditioning protocols, when considering early local components (<80 ms). Each intensity in the three regions was associated with complex patterns of oscillatory activities. The quality of the regression of TEPs over stimulation intensity was used to derive a new readout for cortical excitability and dynamical properties, revealing lower excitability in the DLPFC, followed by SOL and M1. The realistic sham experiment confirmed that these early local components were not contaminated by multisensory stimulations. This study provides an entirely new analytic framework to characterize input-output relations throughout the cortex, paving the way to a more accurate definition of local cortical excitability.

AB  - PurposeTo explore the difference in rehabilitation effect between soft robot gloves and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in patients with severe upper limb motor dysfunction after a stroke. MethodsA total of 69 post-stroke patients with severe upper limb dysfunction were randomly assigned to a repetitive transcranial magnetic group, a soft robotic glove group, and a conventional treatment group. The primary outcomes were the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment (FMA-UE) and the Modified Barthel Index (MBI). The secondary endpoints were the amplitude surface electromyogram of the extensor wrist muscle (sEMG) and the cerebral hemispheric resting motor threshold (RMT). ResultsThe change of FMA-UE score in the soft robotic glove group was significantly better than that in the conventional treatment group (median difference: 2 points; 95% confidence interval [1, 3]; P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference compared with the repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation group (median difference: 0 points; 95% confidence interval [-1, 2]; P [0.547] > 0.05). There was no significant difference in the change of MBI score between the soft robotic glove group and the conventional treatment and repetitive transcranial magnetic treatment groups [F = 2.458, P [0.093] > 0.05]. There was no significant difference in the change of sEMG score between the soft robotic glove group and the conventional treatment and repetitive transcranial magnetic treatment groups [H = 0.042, P [0.980] > 0.05]. Additionally, the change of RMT score in the soft robotic glove group was significantly inferior to that in the repetitive transcranial magnetic treatment group [difference: -1.09; 95% confidence interval [-2.048, 0.048]; P < 0.05], but there was no significant difference compared with the conventional treatment group [difference: 0.31 points; 95% confidence interval [-0.879, 0.358]; P [0.495] > 0.05]. ConclusionFor patients with severe dyskinesia after a stroke, soft robotic gloves are as effective as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and may be a good choice for home rehabilitation. In addition, conventional treatment combined with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or a soft robotic glove produced better rehabilitation outcomes than conventional treatment alone.

AB  - Neurorehabilitation devices and technologies are crucial for enhancing stroke recovery. These include noninvasive brain stimulation devices that provide repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation, which can remodulate an injured brain. Technologies such as robotics, virtual reality, and telerehabilitation are suitable add-ons or complements to physical therapy. However, the appropriate application of these devices and technologies, which target specific deficits and stages, for stroke therapy must be clarified. Accordingly, a literature review was conducted to evaluate the theoretical and practical evidence on the use of neurorehabilitation devices and technologies for stroke therapy. This narrative review provides a practical guide for the use of neurorehabilitation devices and describes the implications of use and potential integration of these devices into healthcare.

AB  - Background: Theoretical and empirical work suggest that addictive drugs potentiate dopaminergic reinforcement learning signals and disrupt the reward function of its neural targets, including the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) and the basal ganglia. Here, we aim to use prefrontal 10-Hz TMS to enhance aMCC reward activity and reward learning by the basal ganglia in problematic substance users.
   Methods: 22 problematic substance users were randomized into an Active and SHAM (coil flipped) TMS group. We recorded the reward positivity-an electrophysiological signal believed to index sensitivity of the aMCC to rewards-while participants engaged in 4 blocks (100 trials per block) of a reward-based choice task. A robotic arm positioned a TMS coil over a prefrontal cortex target, and 50 pulses were delivered at 10-Hz before every 10 trials of blocks 2-4 (1500 pulses, 400 trials). Participants then completed a decision-making task that is diagnostic of striatal dopamine dysfunction.
   Results: The present study revealed three main findings. First, both groups failed to elicit a reward positivity during the first two task blocks. Second, applying robot-assisted TMS enhanced the amplitude of the reward positivity in the Active group, but not the SHAM group, across the last two task blocks. Third, the Active group performed relatively better at reward-based learning than the SHAM group.
   Conclusion: These results demonstrate that 10-Hz TMS is successful in modulating the reward function of the aMCC and basal ganglia in problematic substance users, which may have utility in the treatment of reward related neural dysfunction commonly associated with substance use disorders.

AB  - Background: Non-invasive brain stimulation is being increasingly used to interrogate neurophysiology and modulate brain function. Despite the high scientific and therapeutic potential of non-invasive brain stimulation, experience in the developing brain has been limited.
   Objective: To determine the safety and tolerability of non-invasive neurostimulation in children across diverse modalities of stimulation and pediatric populations.
   Methods: A non-invasive brain stimulation program was established in 2008 at our pediatric, academic institution. Multi-disciplinary neurophysiological studies included single- and paired-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) methods. Motor mapping employed robotic TMS. Interventional trials included repetitive TMS (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Standardized safety and tolerability measures were completed prospectively by all participants.
   Results: Over 10 years, 384 children underwent brain stimulation (median 13 years, range 0.8-18.0). Populations included typical development (n = 118), perinatal stroke/cerebral palsy (n = 101), mild traumatic brain injury (n = 121) neuropsychiatric disorders (n = 37), and other (n = 7). No serious adverse events occurred. Drop-outs were rare (<1%). No seizures were reported despite >100 participants having brain injuries and/or epilepsy. Tolerability between single and paired-pulse TMS (542340 stimulations) and rTMS (3.0 million stimulations) was comparable and favourable. TMS-related headache was more common in perinatal stroke (40%) than healthy participants (13%) but was mild and self-limiting. Tolerability improved over time with side-effect frequency decreasing by >50%. Robotic TMS motor mapping was well-tolerated though neck pain was more common than with manual TMS (33% vs 3%). Across 612 tDCS sessions including 92 children, tolerability was favourable with mild itching/tingling reported in 37%.
   Conclusions: Standard non-invasive brain stimulation paradigms are safe and well-tolerated in children and should be considered minimal risk. Advancement of applications in the developing brain are warranted. A new and improved pediatric NIBS safety and tolerability form is included. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The trajectory of the manipulator can be transformed into the position and time series in the joint space by Inverse Kinematics (IK). Among the splines, quintic B-spline used commonly for interpolating robotic trajectories is preferred also in this study. Under the constraints of the manipulator, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms-II (NSGA-II) is used to optimize the objective function. The total optimized running time is shortened by 33.07 s. The main joints damage before and after optimization of safety collision have been reduced more than 49.4%. After quintic B-spline interpolation, the time-safety collision of manipulator trajectory are effectively optimized. In general, the execution efficiency of the manipulator is improved, the collision damage to the human head is reduced, and the motion control performance of TMS manipulator is improved to be widely used in medical clinic.

AB  - Combined interventions for neuromodulation leading to neurorecovery have gained great attention by researchers to resemble clinical rehabilitation approaches. In this randomized clinical trial, we established changes in the net output of motoneurons innervating multiple leg muscles during stepping when transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex was paired with transcutaneous spinal (transspinal) stimulation over the thoracolumbar region during locomotor training. TMS was delivered before (TMS-transspinal) or after (transspinal-TMS) transspinal stimulation during the stance phase of the less impaired leg. Ten individuals with chronic incomplete or complete SCI received at least 20 sessions of training. Each session consisted of 240 paired stimuli delivered over 10-min blocks for 1 h during robotic assisted step training on a motorized treadmill. Body weight support, leg guidance force and treadmill speed were adjusted based on each subject's ability to step without knee buckling or toe dragging. Most transspinal evoked potentials (TEPs) recorded before and after each intervention from ankle and knee muscles during assisted stepping were modulated in a phase-dependent pattern. Transspinal-TMS and locomotor training affected motor neuron output of knee and ankle muscles with ankle TEPs to be modulated in a phase-dependent manner. TMS-transspinal and locomotor training increased motor neuron output for knee but not for ankle muscles. Our results support that targeted brain and spinal cord stimulation alters responsiveness of neurons over multiple spinal segments in people with chronic SCI. Noninvasive stimulation of the brain and spinal cord along with locomotor training is a novel neuromodulation method that can become a promising modality for rehabilitation in humans after SCI.

AB  - Background Since birth, during the exploration of the environment to interact with objects, we exploit both the motor and sensory components of the upper limb (UL). This ability to integrate sensory and motor information is often compromised following a stroke. However, to date, rehabilitation protocols are focused primarily on recovery of motor function through physical therapies. Therefore, we have planned a clinical trial to investigate the effect on functionality of UL after a sensorimotor transcranial stimulation (real vs sham) in add-on to robot-assisted therapy in the stroke population.Methods A randomised double-blind controlled trial design involving 32 patients with a single chronic stroke (onset > 180 days) was planned. Each patient will undergo 15 consecutive sessions (5 days for 3 weeks) of paired associative stimulation (PAS) coupled with UL robot-assisted therapy. PAS stimulation will be administered using a bifocal transcranial magnetic stimulator (TMS) on the posterior-parietal cortex and the primary motor area (real or sham) of the lesioned hemisphere. Clinical, kinematics and neurophysiological changes will be evaluated at the end of protocol and at 1-month follow-up and compared with baseline. The Fugl-Meyer assessment scale will be the primary outcome. Secondly, kinematic variables will be recorded during the box-and-block test and reaching tasks using video analysis and inertial sensors. Single pulse TMS and electroencephalography will be used to investigate the changes in local cortical reactivity and in the interconnected areas.Discussion The presented trial shall evaluate with a multimodal approach the effects of sensorimotor network stimulation applied before a robot-assisted therapy training on functional recovery of the upper extremity after stroke. The combination of neuromodulation and robot-assisted therapy can promote an increase of cortical plasticity of sensorimotor areas followed by a clinical benefit in the motor function of the upper limb.

AB  - Study Design. A systematic review and meta-analysis. Objective. This study was performed to evaluate the effects of different rehabilitation interventions in spinal cord injury. Summary of Background Data. Several activity-based interventions have been widely applied in spinal cord injury in the past, but the effects of these rehabilitation exercises are controversial. Methods. Publications were searched from databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, the database of the U.S. National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) using the searching terms like spinal cord injury, transcranial magnetic stimulation, functional electrical stimulation, activity-based therapy, and robotic-assisted locomotor training. Randomized controlled trials and controlled trials were included. The primary outcomes included functional upper/lower extremity independence, walking capacity, spasticity, and life quality of individuals with spinal cord injury. Meta-analysis was performed using Revman 5.0 software. Results. Thirty-one articles were included. Meta-analysis showed that transcranial magnetic stimulation improved walking speed (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01, 0.16) and lower extremity function (95% CI 1.55, 7.27); functional electrical stimulation significantly increased upper extremity independence (95% CI 0.37, 5.48). Robotic-assisted treadmill training improved lower extremity function (95% CI 3.44, 6.56) compared with related controls. Conclusion. Activity-based intervention like transcranial magnetic stimulation, functional electrical stimulation, and robotic-assisted treadmill training are effective in improving function in individuals with spinal cord injury.

AB  - This study demonstrated that upper limb robotic therapy (ULRT) combined with 1 Hz low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (LF-rTMS) improved upper limb (UL) function and activities of daily living (ADLs) in stroke patients. 16 stroke patients were treated with 1 Hz LF-rTMS on non-affected cerebral hemisphere, 8 in ULRT group, and 8 in the UL combined with traditional occupational therapy (ULTOT) group. Assessment include fugl-meyer assessment (FMA), modified ashworth scale (MAS), and modified barthel index (MBI). As a result, ULRT group showed significant differences in FMA, MAS, and MBI (p<0.05), and ULTOT group showed significant differences in FMA and MBI in two groups (p<0.05). There were significant differences in FMA, MAS, and MBI between two groups (p<0.05) (p<0.001). Through this, ULTOT group and ULRT group with 1 Hz LF-rTMS helped UL function and ADLs. In particular, ULRT with 1 Hz LF-rTMS helped improve UL function and ADLs.

AB  - (1) Background: This systematic review aimed to focus on the effects of rehabilitation interventions combined with noninvasive brain stimulation on upper limb motor function in stroke patients. (2) Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, and CINAHL were used for the literature research. Articles were searched using the following terms: "Stroke OR CVA OR cerebrovascular accident" AND "upper limb OR upper extremity" AND "NIBS OR Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation" OR "rTMS" OR "repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation" OR "tDCS" OR "transcranial direct current stimulation" AND "RCT" OR randomized control trial." In total, 12 studies were included in the final analysis. (3) Results: Analysis using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale for qualitative evaluation of the literature rated eight articles as "excellent" and four as "good." Combined rehabilitation interventions included robotic therapy, motor imagery using brain-computer interaction, sensory control, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, task-oriented approach, task-oriented mirror therapy, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and behavior observation therapy. (4) Conclusions: Although it is difficult to estimate the recovery of upper limb motor function in stroke patients treated with noninvasive brain stimulation alone, a combination of a task-oriented approach, occupational therapy, action observation, wrist robot-assisted rehabilitation, and physical therapy can be effective.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis is a slowly progressive disease, immunosuppressants and other drugs can delay the progression and progression of the disease, but the most patients will be left with varying degrees of neurological deficit symptoms, such as muscle weakness, muscle spasm, ataxia, sensory impairment, dysphagia, cognitive dysfunction, psychological disorders, etc. From the early stage of the disease to the stage of disease progression, professional rehabilitation treatment can reduce the functional dysfunction of multiple sclerosis patients, improve neurological function, and reduce family and social burdens. With the development of various new rehabilitation technologies such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, virtual reality technology, robot-assisted gait, telerehabilitation and transcranial direct current stimulation, the advantages of rehabilitation therapy in multiple sclerosis treatment have been further established, and more treatment means have also been provided for patients.

AB  - Deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi-DBS) is an effective treatment for primary dystonia; however, its therapeutic mechanism is poorly understood. Because improvement is gradual, GPi-DBS treatment likely involves short- and long-term mechanisms. Abnormal plasticity resulting in somatotopic reorganization is involved in the development of dystonia and has been proposed as a possible mechanism for this gradual improvement, yet it has not been directly investigated. We hypothesized that GPi-DBS will lead to progressive changes in the cortical representations (motor maps) of upper limb muscles. Neuronavigated robotic transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to map the cortical representation of five upper limb muscles in six healthy controls and a 45-yr-old female cervical dystonia patient before (Pre) and at four time points (Post5 to Post314). 5 to 314 days after GPi-DBS. Motor map area and volume decreased in all muscles following GPi-DBS, while changes in overlap and center of gravity distance between muscles were variable. Despite these motor map changes. only dystonic tremor improved after a year of DBS; neck position worsened slightly. These preliminary findings suggest that GPi-DBS may reduce the cortical representation and excitability of upper limb muscles in dystonia and that these changes can occur without clinical improvement.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Neuronavigated robotic transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to investigate changes in upper limb muscle representation in a cervical dystonia patient before and at four time points up to 314 days after globus pallidus pars interna deep brain stimulation (GPi-DBS). GPi-DBS altered excitability and motor cortical representation of upper limb muscles; however, these changes were not associated with clinical improvement.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effect of robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) therapy combined with non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) on lower limb function in patients with stroke and spinal cord injury (SCI). Data sources PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science were searched. Study selection Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published as of 3 March 2021. RCTs evaluating RAGT combined with NIBS, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), for lower limb function (e.g., Fugl-Meyer assessment for patients with stroke) and activities (i.e., gait velocity) in patients with stroke and SCI were included. Data extraction Two reviewers independently screened the records, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias. Data synthesis A meta-analysis of five studies (104 participants) and risk of bias were conducted. Pooled estimates demonstrated that RAGT combined with NIBS significantly improved lower limb function [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.06-0.99] but not lower limb activities (SMD = -0.13; 95% CI = -0.63-0.38). Subgroup analyses also failed to find a greater improvement in lower limb function of RAGT with tDCS compared to sham stimulation. No significant differences between participant characteristics or types of NIBS were observed. Conclusion This meta-analysis demonstrated that RAGT therapy in combination with NIBS was effective in patients with stroke and SCI. However, a greater improvement in lower limb function and activities were not observed using RAGT with tDCS compared to sham stimulation.

AB  - Background: Robotic devices have been used to rehabilitate walking function after stroke. Although results suggest that post-stroke patients benefit from this non-conventional therapy, there is no agreement on the optimal robot-assisted approaches to promote neurorecovery. Here we present a new robotic therapy protocol using a grounded exoskeleton perturbing the ankle joint based on tacit learning control.
   Method: Ten healthy individuals and a post-stroke patient participated in the study and were enrolled in a pilot intervention protocol that involved performance of ankle movements following different trajectories via video game visual feedback. The system autonomously modulated task difficulty according to the performance to increase the challenge. We hypothesized that motor learning throughout training sessions would lead to increased corticospinal excitability of dorsi-plantarflexor muscles. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation was used to assess the effects on corticospinal excitability.
   Results: Improvements have been observed on task performance and motor outcomes in both healthy individuals and post-stroke patient case study. Tibialis Anterior corticospinal excitability increased significantly after the training; however no significant changes were observed on Soleus corticospinal excitability. Clinical scales showed functional improvements in the stroke patient.

AB  - Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) coupled to robotic assistive devices have shown promise for the rehabilitation of stroke patients. However, little has been reported that compares the clinical and physiological effects of a BCI intervention for upper limb stroke rehabilitation with those of conventional therapy. This study assesses the feasibility of an intervention with a BCI based on electroencephalography (EEG) coupled to a robotic hand orthosis for upper limb stroke rehabilitation and compares its outcomes to conventional therapy. Seven subacute and three chronic stroke patients (M = 59.9 +/- 12.8) with severe upper limb impairment were recruited in a crossover feasibility study to receive 1 month of BCI therapy and 1 month of conventional therapy in random order. The outcome measures were comprised of: Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), motor evoked potentials elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), hand dynamometry, and EEG. Additionally, BCI performance and user experience were measured. All measurements were acquired before and after each intervention. FMA-UE and ARAT after BCI (23.1 +/- 16; 8.4 +/- 10) and after conventional therapy (21.9 +/- 15; 8.7 +/- 11) were significantly higher (p < 0.017) compared to baseline (17.5 +/- 15; 4.3 +/- 6) but were similar between therapies (p > 0.017). Via TMS, corticospinal tract integrity could be assessed in the affected hemisphere of three patients at baseline, in five after BCI, and four after conventional therapy. While no significant difference (p > 0.05) was found in patients' affected hand strength, it was higher after the BCI therapy. EEG cortical activations were significantly higher over motor and non-motor regions after both therapies (p < 0.017). System performance increased across BCI sessions, from 54 (50, 70%) to 72% (56, 83%). Patients reported moderate mental workloads and excellent usability with the BCI. Outcome measurements implied that a BCI intervention using a robotic hand orthosis as feedback has the potential to elicit neuroplasticity-related mechanisms, similar to those observed during conventional therapy, even in a group of severely impaired stroke patients. Therefore, the proposed BCI system could be a suitable therapy option and will be further assessed in clinical trials.

AB  - Background A novel electromechanical robotic-exoskeleton was designed in-house for the rehabilitation of wrist joint and Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. Objective The objective was to compare the rehabilitation effectiveness (clinical-scales and neurophysiological-measures) of robotic-therapy training sessions with dose-matched conventional therapy in patients with stroke. Methods A pilot prospective parallel randomized controlled study at clinical settings was designed for patients with stroke within 2 years of chronicity. Patients were randomly assigned to receive an intervention of 20 sessions of 45 min each, five days a week for four weeks, in Robotic-therapy Group (RG) (n = 12) and conventional upper-limb rehabilitation in Control-Group (CG) (n = 11). We intended to evaluate the effects of a novel exoskeleton based therapy on the functional rehabilitation outcomes of upper-limb and cortical-excitability in patients with stroke as compared to the conventional-rehabilitation. Clinical-scales- Modified Ashworth Scale, Active Range of Motion, Barthel-Index, Brunnstrom-stage and Fugl-Meyer (FM) scale and neurophysiological measures of cortical-excitability (using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) -Motor Evoked Potential and Resting Motor threshold, were acquired pre- and post-therapy. Results No side effects were noticed in any of the patients. Both RG and CG showed significant (p < 0.05) improvement in all clinical motor-outcomes except Modified Ashworth Scale in CG. RG showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher improvement over CG in Modified Ashworth Scale, Active Range of Motion and Fugl-Meyer scale and FM Wrist-/Hand component. An increase in cortical-excitability in ipsilesional-hemisphere was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05) in RG over CG, as indexed by a decrease in Resting Motor Threshold and increase in the amplitude of Motor Evoked Potential. No significant changes were shown by the contralesional-hemisphere. Interhemispheric RMT-asymmetry evidenced significant (p < 0.05) changes in RG over CG indicating increased cortical-excitability in ipsilesional-hemisphere along with interhemispheric changes. Conclusion Robotic-exoskeleton training showed improvement in motor outcomes and cortical-excitability in patients with stroke. Neurophysiological changes in RG could most likely be a consequence of plastic reorganization and use-dependent plasticity. Trial registry number: ISRCTN95291802

AB  - The communication through coherence hypothesis suggests that only coherently oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively and predicts an intrinsic response modulation along the oscillatory rhythm. For the motor cortex (MC) at rest, the oscillatory cycle has been shown to determine the brain's responsiveness to external stimuli. For the active MC, however, the demonstration of such a phase-specific modulation of corticospinal excitability (CSE) along the rhythm cycle is still missing. Motor evoked potentials in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the MC were used to probe the effect of cortical oscillations on CSE during several motor conditions. A brain-machine interface (BMI) with a robotic hand orthosis allowed investigating effects of cortical activity on CSE without the confounding effects of voluntary muscle activation. Only this BMI approach (and not active or passive hand opening alone) revealed a frequency- and phase-specific cortical modulation of CSE by sensorimotor beta-band activity that peaked once per oscillatory cycle and was independent of muscle activity. The active MC follows an intrinsic response modulation in accordance with the communication through coherence hypothesis. Furthermore, the BMI approach may facilitate and strengthen effective corticospinal communication in a therapeutic context, for example, when voluntary hand opening is no longer possible after stroke.

AB  - Objective: To study motor cortex plasticity after a period of training with a new prototype of bidirectional hand prosthesis in three left trans-radial amputees, correlating these changes with the modification of Phantom Limb Pain (PLP) in the same period.
   Methods: Each subject underwent a brain motor mapping with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and PLP evaluation with questionnaires during a six-month training with a prototype of bidirectional hand prosthesis.
   Results: The baseline motor maps showed in all three amputees a smaller area of muscles representation of the amputated side compared to the intact limb. After training, there was a partial reversal of the baseline asymmetry. The two subjects affected by PLP experienced a statistically significant reduction of pain.
   Conclusions: Two apparently opposite findings, the invasion of the "deafferented" cortex by neighbouring areas and the "persistence" of neural structures after amputation, could vary according to different target used for measurement. Our results do not support a correlation between PLP and motor cortical changes.
   Significance: The selection of the target and of the task is essential for studies investigating motor brain plasticity. This study boosts against a direct and unique role of motor cortical changes on PLP genesis. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

AB  - Neurological diseases severely affect the quality of life of patients. Although existing treatments including rehabilitative therapy aim to facilitate the recovery of motor function, achieving complete recovery remains a challenge. In recent years, regenerative therapy has been considered as a potential candidate that could yield complete functional recovery. However, to achieve desirable results, integration of transplanted cells into neural networks and generation of appropriate microenvironments are essential. Furthermore, considering the nascent state of research in this area, we must understand certain aspects about regenerative therapy, including specific effects, nature of interaction when administered in combination with rehabilitative therapy (regenerative rehabilitation), and optimal conditions. Herein, we review the current status of research in the field of regenerative therapy, discuss the findings that could hold the key to resolving the challenges associated with regenerative rehabilitation, and outline the challenges to be addressed with future studies. The current state of research emphasizes the importance of determining the independent effect of regenerative and rehabilitative therapies before exploring their combined effects. Furthermore, the current review highlights the progression in the treatment perspective from a state of compensation of lost function to that of a possibility of complete functional recovery.

AB  - Introduction: Innovative motor therapies have attempted to reduce upper extremity impairment after stroke but have not made substantial improvement as over 50% of people post-stroke continue to have sensorimotor deficits affecting their self-care and participation in daily activities. Intervention studies have focused on the role of increased dosing, however recent studies have indicated that timing of rehabilitation interventions may be as important as dosing and importantly, that dosing and timing interact in mediating effectiveness. This study is designed to empirically test dosing and timing.
   Methods and Analysis: In this single-blinded, interventional study, subjects will be stratified on two dimensions, impairment level (Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment (FM) and presence or absence of Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) as follows; (1) Severe, FM score 10-19, MEP+, (2) Severe, FM score 10-19, MEP-, (3) Moderate, FM score 20-49, MEP+, (4) Moderate, FM score 20-49, MEP-. Subjects not eligible for TMS will be assigned to either group 2 (if severe) or group 3 (if moderate). Stratified block randomization will then be used to achieve a balanced assignment. Early Robotic/VR Therapy (EVR) experimental group will receive in-patient usual care therapy plus an extra 10 h of intensive upper extremity therapy focusing on the hand using robotically facilitated rehabilitation interventions presented in virtual environments and initiated 5-30 days post-stroke. Delayed Robotic/VR Therapy (DVR) experimental group will receive the same intervention but initiated 30-60 days post-stroke. Dose-matched usual care group (DMUC) will receive an extra 10 h of usual care initiated 5-30 days post-stroke. Usual Care Group (UC) will receive the usual amount of physical/occupational therapy.
   Outcomes: There are clinical, neurophysiological, and kinematic/kinetic measures, plus measures of daily arm use and quality of life. Primary outcome is the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) measured at 4 months post-stroke.
   Discussion: Outcome measures will be assessed to determine whether there is an early time period in which rehabilitation will be most effective, and whether there is a difference in the recapture of premorbid patterns of movement vs. the development of an efficient, but compensatory movement strategy.
   Ethical Considerations: The IRBs of New Jersey Institute of Technology, Rutgers University, Northeastern University, and Kessler Foundation reviewed and approved all study protocols. Study was registered in (NCT03569059) prior to recruitment. Dissemination will include submission to peer-reviewed journals and professional presentations.

AB  - Mechanical stimulation-conditioned transcranial magnetic stimulation (Mstim-cTMS) is a neuromodulation technique that transiently enhances neural excitability through paired peripheral and cortical stimulation. Importantly, the temporal inter-stimulus interval (ISI) must fall within an individual's specific ISI window (ISI-W) to induce neuromodulatory effects. Currently, ISI-W identification is inefficient, incrementally applying Mstim-cTMS within a wide search range. This paper aims to test a real-time, closed-loop framework that decreases the number of trials required to obtain individualized ISI-Ws by implementing a previously developed statistical regression algorithm. Each Mstim-cTMS trial consisted of peripheral mechanical stimulation using a precise, tapping robot paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation to the motor cortex. Neuromodulation was characterized by measuring resulting motor evoked potentials (MEPs). The closed-loop process estimated the effective ISI-W by iterating Mstim-cTMS at statistically determined ISIs based on the detected MEPs. The estimated ISI-Ws of two subjects had an average correlation coefficient of 0.84 with their reference windows obtained using the conventional search method. The estimation reduced the number of required Mstim-cTMS trials by an average of 93.8%. The results indicate the proposed method's potential for decreasing Mstim-cTMS startup durations. Future rehabilitation and neurophysiological studies can benefit from efficiently updating ISI-Ws to account for long-term neural variability.

AB  - ContextMotor deficits are among the most common consequences of incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). These impairments can affect patients' levels of functioning and quality of life. Combined robotic therapy and non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) have been used to improve motor impairments in patients with corticospinal tract lesions.ObjectivesTo examine the effects of combined robotic therapy and NIBS on motor function post incomplete SCI.MethodsPubMed, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, PEDro, Web of Science, REHABDATA, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched from inception until July 2023. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale was employed to evaluate the selected studies quality.ResultsOf 557 studies, five randomized trials (n = 122), with 25% of participants being females, were included in this review. The PEDro scores ranged from eight to nine, with a median score of nine. There were variations in treatment protocols and outcome measures, resulting in heterogeneous findings. The findings showed revealed evidence for the impacts of combined robotic therapy and NIBS on motor function in individuals with incomplete SCI.ConclusionsCombined robotic training and NIBS may be safe for individuals with incomplete SCI. The existing evidence concerning its effects on motor outcomes in individuals with SCI is limited. Further experimental studies are needed to understand the effects of combined robotic training and NIBS on motor impairments in SCI populations.

AB  - Reviews about early interventions, which are important in stroke rehabilitation due to significant neural plasticity, are relatively less. This study objective was to investigate the effectiveness of different interventions started within one-month post-stroke in improving lower extremity-related outcomes as compared to conventional rehabilitation and the corresponding effectiveness ranking. Cochrane Library, Ovid, PubMed, and Scopus were searched for articles dated up to 18 March 2022. Randomised controlled trials were included if they evaluated the effectiveness of two or more different non-drug, non-invasive, and non-surgical interventions which were started within one-month post-stroke on lower extremity-related outcomes. Network meta-analysis revealed that transcranial direct current stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, mirror therapy, cycling, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), combination of robot and NMES, and thermal stimulation were significantly more effective in improving lower extremity motor function than conventional rehabilitation. In improving mobility, mirror therapy, cycling, and thermal stimulation were significantly more effective. In enhancing balance, physio ball, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, cycling, thermal stimulation, and robot showed significantly higher effectiveness. Thermal stimulation scored the highest effectiveness ranking in improving lower extremity motor function and mobility whereas robot and backward walking achieved the highest effectiveness ranking in improving balance and gait speed respectively.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which arose in late 2019, caused extensive destruction, impacting a substantial proportion of the worldwide population and leading to millions of deaths. Although COVID-19 is mainly linked to respiratory and pulmonary complications, it has the potential to affect neurologic structures as well. Neurological involvement may manifest as minimal and reversible; however, a notable proportion of cases have exhibited pronounced neurological consequences, such as strokes. Endothelial inflammation, hypercoagulation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system alterations, and cardiogenic embolism are the pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke under COVID-19 circumstances. Physical activity and exercise have improved several aspects of post-stroke recovery, including cardiovascular health, walking capacity, and upper limb strength. They are commonly used to assist stroke survivors in overcoming their motor restrictions. Furthermore, stroke rehabilitation can incorporate a range of specific techniques, including body-weight-supported treadmill applications, constraint-induced movement therapy, robotic rehabilitation interventions, transcranial direct current stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and prism adaptation training. Under pandemic conditions, there were several barriers to neurological rehabilitation. The most significant of these were individual's fear of infection, which caused them to postpone their rehabilitation applications and rehabilitation areas being converted into COVID-19 units. The primary emphasis had turned to COVID-19 treatment. Several valuable data and views were gained in reorganizing rehabilitation during the pandemic, contributing to establishing future views in this regard.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect and mechanism of robot-assisted upper limb training (RT) combined with intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) for stroke patients are unclear.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in brain activation after combination therapy and RT alone using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).
   METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to two groups (iTBS + RT Group, n = 18, and RT Group, n = 18). Training was conducted five times a week for four weeks. fNIRS was used to measure changes in oxyhemoglobin in both the primary motor cortex (M1) and pre-motor and supplementary motor area (pSMA) during affected limb movement. Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) was employed for evaluating the function of upper limbs.
   RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with subacute stroke completed the study. The cortex of both hemispheres was extensively activated prior to treatment in the RT group. After training, overactivation decreased. The brain activation of the combined treatment group transferred to the affected side after the treatment. There was a notable enhancement in the FMA-UE scores for both groups, with the combined group's progress significantly surpassing that of the RT group.
   CONCLUSION: RT combined with iTBS can improve the motor function of stroke patients and promote the balance between cerebral hemispheres.

AB  - In recent years, the neural control mechanisms of the arms and legs during human bipedal walking have been clarified. Rhythmic leg stepping leads to suppression of monosynaptic reflex excitability in forearm muscles. However, it is unknown whether and how corticospinal excitability of the forearm muscle is modulated during leg stepping. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the excitability of the corticospinal tract in the forearm muscle during passive and voluntary stepping. To compare the neural effects on corticospinal excitability to those on monosynaptic reflex excitability, the present study also assessed the excitability of the H-reflex in the forearm muscle during both types of stepping. A robotic gait orthosis was used to produce leg stepping movements similar to those of normal walking. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and H-reflexes were evoked in the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle during passive and voluntary stepping. The results showed that FCR MEP amplitudes were significantly enhanced during the mid-stance and terminal-swing phases of voluntary stepping, while there was no significant difference between the phases during passive stepping. Conversely, the FCR H-reflex was suppressed during both voluntary and passive stepping, compared to the standing condition. The present results demonstrated that voluntary commands to leg muscles, combined with somatosensory inputs, may facilitate corticospinal excitability in the forearm muscle, and that somatosensory inputs during walking play a major role in monosynaptic reflex suppression in forearm muscle.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been proposed to treat neuropathic pain but the quality of evidence remains low. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of neuronavigated rTMS to the primary motor cortex (M1) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in neuropathic pain over 25 weeks.
   We carried out a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at four outpatient clinics in France. Patients aged 18-75 years with peripheral neuropathic pain were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to M1 or DLPFC-rTMS and rerandomized at a 2:1 ratio to active or sham-rTMS (10 Hz, 3000 pulses/session, 15 sessions over 22 weeks). Patients and investigators were blind to treatment allocation. The primary end point was the comparison between active M1-rTMS, active DLPCF-rTMS and sham-rTMS for the change over the course of 25 weeks (Group x Time interaction) in average pain intensity (from 0 no pain to 10 maximal pain) on the Brief Pain Inventory, using a mixed model repeated measures analysis in patients who received at least one rTMS session (modified intention-to-treat population). Secondary outcomes included other measures of pain intensity and relief, sensory and affective dimensions of pain, quality of pain, self-reported pain intensity and fatigue (patients diary), Patient and Clinician Global Impression of Change (PGIC, CGIC), quality of life, sleep, mood and catastrophizing. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02010281.
   A total of 152 patients were randomized and 149 received treatment (49 for M1; 52 for DLPFC; 48 for sham). M1-rTMS reduced pain intensity versus sham-rTMS (estimate for Group x Session interaction: -0.048 +/- 0.02; 95% CI: -0.09 to -0.01; P = 0.01). DLPFC-rTMS was not better than sham (estimate: -0.003 +/- 0.01; 95% CI: -0.04 to 0.03, P = 0.9). M1-rRMS, but not DLPFC-rTMS, was also superior to sham-rTMS on pain relief, sensory dimension of pain, self-reported pain intensity and fatigue, PGIC and CGIC. There were no effects on quality of pain, mood, sleep and quality of life as all groups improved similarly over time. Headache was the most common side effect and occurred in 17 (34.7%), 23 (44.2%) and 13 (27.1%) patients from M1, DLPFC and sham groups, respectively (P = 0.2). Our results support the clinical relevance of M1-rTMS, but not of DLPFC-rTMS, for peripheral neuropathic pain with an excellent safety profile.

AB  - Gait recovery is a fundamental goal in patients with spinal cord injury to attain greater autonomy and quality of life. Robotics is becoming a valid tool in improving motor, balance, and gait function in this patient population. Moreover, other innovative approaches are leading to promising results. The aim of this study was to investigate new rehabilitative methods for gait recovery in people who have suffered spinal cord injuries. A systematic review of the last 10 years of the literature was performed in three databases (PubMed, PEDro, andCochrane). We followed this PICO of the review: P: adults with non-progressive spinal cord injury; I: new rehabilitative methods; C: new methods vs. conventional methods; and O: improvement of gait parameters. When feasible, a comparison through ES forest plots was performed. A total of 18 RCTs of the 599 results obtained were included. The studies investigated robotic rehabilitation (n = 10), intermittent hypoxia (N = 3) and external stimulation (N = 5). Six studies of the first group (robotic rehabilitation) were compared using a forest plot for 10MWT, LEMS, WISCI-II, and SCIM-3. The other clinical trials were analyzed through a narrative review of the results. We found weak evidence for the claim that robotic devices lead to better outcomes in gait independence compared to conventional rehabilitation methods. External stimulation and intermittent hypoxia seem to improve gait parameters associated with other rehabilitation methods. Research investigating the role of innovative technologies in improving gait and balance is needed since walking ability is a fundamental issue in patients with SCI.

AB  - Background Repetitive task practice reduces mean upper extremity motor impairment in populations of patients with chronic stroke, but individual response is highly variable. A method to predict meaningful reduction in impairment in response to training based on biomarkers and other data collected prior to an intervention is needed to establish realistic rehabilitation goals and to effectively allocate resources. Objectives To identify prognostic factors and better understand the biological substrate for reductions in arm impairment in response to repetitive task practice among patients with chronic (>= 6 months) post-stroke hemiparesis. Methods The intervention is a form of repetitive task practice using a combination of robot-assisted therapy and functional arm use in real-world tasks. Baseline measures include the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Wolf Motor Function Test, Action Research Arm Test, Stroke Impact Scale, questionnaires on pain and expectancy, MRI, transcranial magnetic stimulation, kinematics, accelerometry, and genomic testing. Results Mean increase in FM-UE was 4.6 +/- 1.0 SE, median 2.5. Approximately one-third of participants had a clinically meaningful response to the intervention, defined as an increase in FM >= 5. The selected logistic regression model had a receiver operating curve with AUC = .988 (Std Error = .011, 95% Wald confidence limits: .967-1) showed little evidence of overfitting. Six variables that predicted response represented impairment, functional, and genomic measures. Conclusion A simple weighted sum of 6 baseline factors can accurately predict clinically meaningful impairment reduction after outpatient intensive practice intervention in chronic stroke. Reduction of impairment may be a critical first step to functional improvement. Further validation and generalization of this model will increase its utility in clinical decision-making.

AB  - BackgroundThe mechanism of stroke recovery is related to the reorganization of cerebral activity that can be enhanced by rehabilitation therapy. Two well established treatments are Robot-Assisted Therapy (RT) and Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT), however, it is unknown whether there is a difference in the neuroplastic changes induced by these therapies, and if the modifications are related to motor improvement. Therefore, this study aims to identify neurophysiological biomarkers related to motor improvement of participants with chronic stroke that received RT or CIMT, and to test whether there is a difference in neuronal changes induced by these two therapies.MethodsThis study included participants with chronic stroke that took part in a pilot experiment to compare CIMT vs. RT. Neurophysiological evaluations were performed with electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), pre and post rehabilitation therapy. Motor function was measured by the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) and Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Limb (FMA-UL).ResultsTwenty-seven participants with chronic stroke completed the present study [mean age of 58.8 years (SD +/- 13.6), mean time since stroke of 18.2 months (SD +/- 9.6)]. We found that changes in motor threshold (MT) and motor evoked potential (MEP) in the lesioned hemisphere have a positive and negative correlation with WMFT improvement, respectively. The absolute change in alpha peak in the unlesioned hemisphere and the absolute change of the alpha ratio (unlesioned/lesioned hemisphere) is negatively correlated with WMFT improvement. The decrease of EEG power ratio (increase in the lesioned hemisphere and decrease in the unlesioned hemisphere) for high alpha bandwidths is correlated with better improvement in WMFT. The variable "type of treatment (RT or CIMT)" was not significant in the models.ConclusionOur results suggest that distinct treatments (RT and CIMT) have similar neuroplastic mechanisms of recovery. Moreover, motor improvements in participants with chronic stroke are related to decreases of cortical excitability in the lesioned hemisphere measured with TMS. Furthermore, the balance of both EEG power and EEG alpha peak frequency in the lesioned hemisphere is related to motor improvement.

AB  - Background: Physical training is able to induce changes at neurophysiological and behavioral level associated with performance changes for the trained movements. The current study explores the effects of an additional intense robot-assisted upper extremity training on functional outcome and motor excitability in subacute stroke patients.
   Methods: Thirty moderately to severely affected patients < 3 months after stroke received a conventional inpatient rehabilitation. Based on a case-control principle 15 patients were assigned to receive additional 45 min of robot-assisted therapy (Armeo(R)Spring) 5 times per week (n = 15, intervention group, IG). The Fugl-Meyer Assessment for the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) was chosen as primary outcome parameter. Patients were tested before and after a 3-week treatment period as well as after a follow-up period of 2 weeks. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and cortical silent periods were recorded from the deltoid muscle on both sides before and after the intervention period to study effects at neurophysiological level. Statistical analysis was performed with non-parametric tests. Correlation analysis was done with Spearman ' s rank correlation co-efficient.
   Results: Both groups showed a significant improvement in FMA-UE from pre to post (IG: + 10.6 points, control group (CG): + 7.3 points) and from post to follow-up (IG: + 3.9 points, CG: + 3.3 points) without a significant difference between them. However, at neurophysiological level post-intervention MEP amplitudes were significantly larger in the IG but not in the CG. The observed MEP amplitudes changes were positively correlated with FMA-UE changes and with the total amount of robot-assisted therapy.
   Conclusion: The additional robot-assisted therapy induced stronger excitability increases in the intervention group. However, this effect did not transduce to motor performance improvements at behavioral level.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a procedure increasingly used to treat patients with central neuropathic pain, but its efficacy is still under debate. Patients with medically refractory chronic central neuropathic pain were included in 2 randomized phases (active/sham), separated by a wash-out period of 8 weeks. Each phase consisted of 4 consecutive rTMS sessions and a final evaluation session, all separated from one another by 3 weeks. High-frequency (20 Hz) rTMS was delivered over the primary motor cortex (M1) contralateral to the patient's pain using a neuronavigated robotic system. Patients and clinicians assessing outcomes were blinded to treatment allocation during the trial. The primary outcome measured the percentage of pain relief (%R) from baseline. Secondary outcomes were VAS score, Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory, analgesic drug consumption, and quality of life (EQ-5D). Thirty-six patients performed the entire study with no adverse effects. The analgesic effect for the main criterion (%R) was significantly higher in the active (33.8% confidence interval [CI]: [23.88-43.74]) than in the sham phase (13.02% CI: [6.64-19.76]). This was also the case for the secondary outcome VAS (-19.34% CI: [14.31-25.27] vs -4.83% CI: [1.96-8.18]). No difference was observed for quality of life or analgesic drug consumption. Seventeen patients (47%) were identified as responders, but no significant interaction was found between clinical and technical factors considered here and the analgesic response. These results provide strong evidence that 3 weeks spaced high-frequency rTMS of M1 results in a sustained analgesic effect and support the clinical interest of this stimulation paradigm to treat refractory chronic pain.

AB  - Introduction Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), delivered to the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1), appears to enhance the brain's response to rehabilitative training in patients with stroke. However, its clinical utility is highly subject to variability in different protocols. New evidence has reported that preceding iTBS, with continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) may stabilise and even boost the facilitatory effect of iTBS on the stimulated M1, via metaplasticity. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of iTBS primed with cTBS (ie, priming iTBS), in addition to robot-assisted training (RAT), on the improvement of the hemiparetic upper limb functions of stroke patients and to explore potential sensorimotor neuroplasticity using electroencephalography (EEG).
   Methods and analysis A three-arm, subjects and assessors-blinded, randomised controlled trial will be performed with patients with chronic stroke. An estimated sample of 36 patients will be needed based on the prior sample size calculation. All participants will be randomly allocated to receive 10 sessions of rTMS with different TBS protocols (cTBS+iTBS, sham cTBS+iTBS and sham cTBS+sham iTBS), three to five sessions per week, for 2-3 weeks. All participants will receive 60 min of RAT after each stimulation session. Primary outcomes will be assessed using Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity scores and Action Research Arm Test. Secondary outcomes will be assessed using kinematic outcomes generated during RAT and EEG.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from The Human Subjects Ethics Sub-committee, University Research Committee of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (reference number: HSEARS20190718003). The results yielded from this study will be presented at international conferences and sent to a peer-review journal to be considered for publication.

AB  - Gait impairment is one of the most common disorders of patients with chronic stroke, which hugely affects the ability to carry out the activities of daily living and the quality of life. Recently, traditional rehabilitation techniques have been associated with non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, which enhance brain plasticity, with the aim of promoting recovery in patients with chronic stroke. NIBS effectiveness in improving gait parameters in patients with chronic stroke has been in several studies evaluated. Robotic devices are emerging as promising tools for the treatment of stroke-related disabilities by performing repetitive, intensive, and task-specific treatments and have been proved to be effective for the enhancement of motor recovery in patients with chronic stroke. To date, several studies have examined the combination of NIBS with robotic-assisted gait training, but the effectiveness of this approach is not yet well established. The main purpose of this systematic review is to clarify whether the combination of NIBS and robot-assisted gait training may improve walking function in patients with chronic stroke. Our systematic review was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies eligible for review were identified through PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and PEDro from inception to March 15, 2021, and the outcomes considered were gait assessments. Seven studies were included in the qualitative analysis of this systematic review, with a total population of 186 patients with chronic stroke. All studies specified technical characteristics of robotic devices and NIBS used, with high heterogeneity of protocols. Methodological studies have shown a significantly greater improvement in walking capacity recorded with 6MWT. Finally, research studies have highlighted a positive effect on walking recovery by combination of robot-assisted gait training with non-invasive brain stimulation. Furthermore, future studies should identify the best characteristics of the combined therapeutic protocols.

AB  - Spinal cord injury is linked to the interruption of neural pathways, which results in irreversible neural dysfunction. Neural repair and neuroregeneration are critical goals and issues for rehabilitation in spinal cord injury, which require neural stem cell repair and multimodal neuromodulation techniques involving personalized rehabilitation strategies. Besides the involvement of endogenous stem cells in neurogenesis and neural repair, exogenous neural stem cell transplantation is an emerging effective method for repairing and replacing damaged tissues in central nervous system diseases. However, to ensure that endogenous or exogenous neural stem cells truly participate in neural repair following spinal cord injury, appropriate interventional measures (e.g., neuromodulation) should be adopted. Neuromodulation techniques, such as noninvasive magnetic stimulation and electrical stimulation, have been safely applied in many neuropsychiatric diseases. There is increasing evidence to suggest that neuromagnetic/electrical modulation promotes neuroregeneration and neural repair by affecting signaling in the nervous system; namely, by exciting, inhibiting, or regulating neuronal and neural network activities to improve motor function and motor learning following spinal cord injury. Several studies have indicated that fine motor skill rehabilitation training makes use of residual nerve fibers for collateral growth, encourages the formation of new synaptic connections to promote neural plasticity, and improves motor function recovery in patients with spinal cord injury. With the development of biomaterial technology and biomechanical engineering, several emerging treatments have been developed, such as robots, brain-computer interfaces, and nanomaterials. These treatments have the potential to help millions of patients suffering from motor dysfunction caused by spinal cord injury. However, large-scale clinical trials need to be conducted to validate their efficacy. This review evaluated the efficacy of neural stem cells and magnetic or electrical stimulation combined with rehabilitation training and intelligent therapies for spinal cord injury according to existing evidence, to build up a multimodal treatment strategy of spinal cord injury to enhance nerve repair and regeneration.

AB  - Stroke has been one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and is still a social health issue. Keeping in view the importance of physical rehabilitation of stroke patients, an analytical review has been compiled in which different therapies have been reviewed for their effectiveness, such as functional electric stimulation (FES), noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) including transcranial direct current stimulation (t-DCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (t-MS), invasive epidural cortical stimulation, virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation, task-oriented therapy, robot-assisted training, tele rehabilitation, and cerebral plasticity for the rehabilitation of upper extremity motor impairment. New therapeutic rehabilitation techniques are also being investigated, such as VR. This literature review mainly focuses on the randomized controlled studies, reviews, and statistical meta-analyses associated with motor rehabilitation after stroke. Moreover, with the increasing prevalence rate and the adverse socio-economic consequences of stroke, a statistical analysis covering its economic factors such as treatment, medication and post-stroke care services, and risk factors (modifiable and non-modifiable) have also been discussed. This review suggests that if the prevalence rate of the disease remains persistent, a considerable increase in the stroke population is expected by 2025, causing a substantial economic burden on society, as the survival rate of stroke is high compared to other diseases. Compared to all the other therapies, VR has now emerged as the modern approach towards rehabilitation motor activity of impaired limbs. A range of randomized controlled studies and experimental trials were reviewed to analyse the effectiveness of VR as a rehabilitative treatment with considerable satisfactory results. However, more clinical controlled trials are required to establish a strong evidence base for VR to be widely accepted as a preferred rehabilitation therapy for stroke.

AB  - Background Approximately 40% of patients treated for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) do not respond to standard and second-line augmentation treatments leading to the exploration of alternate biological treatments. Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) is a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation inducing more rapid and longer-lasting effects on synaptic plasticity than the latter. To the best of our knowledge, only one recent study and a case report investigated the effect of cTBS at the supplementary motor area (SMA) in OCD. Objective This study aimed to examine the effect of accelerated robotized neuronavigated cTBS over SMA in patients with OCD. Methods A total of 32 patients with OCD were enrolled and randomized into active and sham cTBS groups. For active cTBS stimulation, an accelerated protocol was used. Bursts of three stimuli at 50 Hz, at 80% of MT, repeated at 5 Hz were used. Daily 2 sessions of 900 pulses each, for a total of 30 sessions over 3 wk (weekly 10 sessions), were given. Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Rating Scale (YBOCS), Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) were administered at baseline and at end of weeks 3 and 8. Results A total of 26 patients completed the study. Active cTBS group showed significant group x time effect in YBOCS obsession (P < .001, eta(2) = 0.288), compulsion (P = .004, eta(2) = 0.207), YBOCS total (P < .001, eta(2) = 0.288), CGI-S (P = .010, eta(2) = 0.248), CGI-C (P = .010, eta(2) = 0.248), HAM-D (P = .014, eta(2) = 0.224) than sham cTBS group. Conclusions Findings from our study suggest that adjunctive accelerated cTBS significantly improves psychopathology, severity of illness, and depression among patients with OCD. Future studies with larger sample sizes will add to our knowledge.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel jump control method based on Two Mass Spring Damp Inverted Pendulum (TMS-DIP) model, which makes the third generation of hydraulic driven wheel-legged robot prototype (WLR-3P) achieve stable jumping. Design/methodology/approach First, according to the configuration of the WLR, a TMS-DIP model is proposed to simplify the dynamic model of the robot. Then the jumping process is divided into four stages: thrust, ascent, descent and compression, and each stage is modeled and solved independently based on TMS-DIP model. Through WLR-3P kinematics, the trajectory of the upper and lower centroids of the TMS-DIP model can be mapped to the joint space of the robot. The corresponding control strategies are proposed for jumping height, landing buffer, jumping attitude and robotic balance, so as to realize the stable jump control of the WLR. Findings The TMS-DIP model proposed in this paper can simplify the WLR dynamic model and provide a simple and effective tool for the jumping trajectory planning of the robot. The proposed approach is suitable for hydraulic WLR jumping control. The performance of the proposed wheel-legged jump method was verified by experiments on WLR-3P. Originality/value This work provides an effective model (TMS-DIP) for the jump control of WLR-3P. The results showed that the number of landing shock (twice) and the pitch angle fluctuation range (0.44 rad) of center of mass of the jump control method based on TMS-DIP model are smaller than those based on spring-loaded inverted pendulum model. Therefore, the TMS-DIP model makes the jumping process of WLR more stable and gentler.

AB  - Background:Given the limited healthcare resources in low and middle income countries (LMICs), effective rehabilitation strategies that can be realistically adopted in such settings are required. Objective:A systematic review of literature was conducted to identify pragmatic solutions and outcomes capable of enhancing stroke recovery and quality of life of stroke survivors for low- and middle- income countries. Methods:PubMed, HINARI, and Directory of Open Access Journals databases were searched for published Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) till November 2018. Only completed trials published in English with non-pharmacological interventions on adult stroke survivors were included in the review while published protocols, pilot studies and feasibility analysis of trials were excluded. Obtained data were synthesized thematically and descriptively analyzed. Results:One thousand nine hundred and ninety six studies were identified while 347 (65.22% high quality) RCTs were found to be eligible for the review. The most commonly assessed variables (and outcome measure utility) were activities of daily living [75.79% of the studies, with Barthel Index (37.02%)], motor function [66.57%; with Fugl Meyer scale (71.88%)], and gait [31.12%; with 6 min walk test (38.67%)]. Majority of the innovatively high technology interventions such as robot therapy (95.24%), virtual reality (94.44%), transcranial direct current stimulation (78.95%), transcranial magnetic stimulation (88.0%) and functional electrical stimulation (85.00%) were conducted in high income countries. Several traditional and low-cost interventions such as constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), resistant and aerobic exercises (R&AE), task oriented therapy (TOT), body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) were reported to significantly contribute to the recovery of motor function, activity, participation, and improvement of quality of life after stroke. Conclusion:Several pragmatic, in terms of affordability, accessibility and utility, stroke rehabilitation solutions, and outcome measures that can be used in resource-limited settings were found to be effective in facilitating and enhancing post-stroke recovery and quality of life.

AB  - This study proposes a new software platform, called ROS2-TMS, for an informationally structured environment. An informationally structured environment is vital for developing intelligent service robots by embedding various sensors in the environment to enhance the sensing capability and intelligence of robots. Thus far, we have been developing a software platform, named ROS-TMS, for an informationally structured environment, which connects various sensors and robots using ROS architecture. In recent years, ROS2, a next-generation version of ROS, has been released. ROS2 has many advantages, such as enhanced security, QoS control, and support for various platforms. ROS2-TMS, a new version of ROS-TMS, is developed not only by porting existing modules in ROS-TMS, such as the control system for a communication robot, but also by adding useful functions utilizing new features in ROS2. For instance, we added a voice user interface to control robots and various devices in the environment, such as lights or a bed. In addition, we implemented a new task scheduler that provides a cancelation function to stop running tasks and improve the security of the platform.

AB  - At present, due to the rapid progress of treatment technology in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke, the mortality of patients has been greatly reduced but the number of disabled survivors is increasing, and most of them are elderly patients. Physicians and rehabilitation therapists pay attention to develop all kinds of therapist techniques including physical therapy techniques, robot-assisted technology and artificial intelligence technology, and study the molecular, cellular or synergistic mechanisms of rehabilitation therapies to promote the effect of rehabilitation therapy. Here, we discussed different animal and in vitro models of ischaemic stroke for rehabilitation studies; the compound concept and technology of neurological rehabilitation; all kinds of biological mechanisms of physical therapy; the significance, assessment and efficacy of neurological rehabilitation; the application of brain-computer interface, rehabilitation robotic and non-invasive brain stimulation technology in stroke rehabilitation.

AB  - Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is an increasingly popular research topic due to its extensive potential applications, such as education, healthcare, emergency response, and social interaction. Sign language is a complex and dynamic language comprising hand gestures, facial expressions, and body motions. This high level of variability poses a significant obstacle for SLR tasks, which must accurately identify and respond to numerous gestures. To address these challenges, an end -to -end skeleton -based multi -feature multi -stream multi -level information sharing network (three multi information sharing network (TMS-Net)) is proposed. Specifically, in order to input more rich information to TMS-Net, we use joint feature pair with global features, bone feature pair with local features, and angle feature pair with scale invariance. In terms of network structure, to efficiently extract multiple features from inputs, we build a multi -stream structure and design a multi -level information sharing mechanism based on this structure to ensure the full utilization of skeleton feature information. From the experiment results of the WLASL-2000 dataset (56.4%), AUTSL dataset (96.62%) and MSASL(65.13%), TMS-Net surpass the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with single modality as input. In addition, a SLR -based human-robot interaction (HRI) experiment using our proposed TMS-Net is conducted, which proves the practical performance of the TMS-Net.

AB  - Motor disability is a key feature of many neurological diseases, influencing the social roles of affected patients and their ability to perform daily life activities. Current rehabilitation capacities are overwhelmed by the age-related increase of motor dysfunctions seen, for example, in stroke, extrapyramidal or neuromuscular diseases. As the patient to rehabilitation personnel ration increases, robotic solutions might establish the possibility to rapidly satisfy the increasing demand for rehabilitation. This paper presents an inaugural exploratory study which investigates the interchangeability of a novel experimental robotic rehabilitation device system with classical physical therapy, using a multimodal neurophysiological assessment of the motor system-quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG), motor conduction times and turn/amplitude analysis. Preliminary results show no significant difference between the two methods; however, a significant effect of the therapy was found on different pathologies (beneficial for vascular and extrapyramidal, or limited, and only on preventing reduction of joint movements in neuromuscular).

AB  - Stroke is one of the leading causes of long-term disability. Advanced technological solutions ("neurotechnologies'') exploiting robotic systems and electrodes that stimulate the nervous system can increase the efficacy of stroke rehabilitation. Recent studies on these approaches have shown promising results. However, a paradigm shift in the development of new approaches must be made to significantly improve the clinical outcomes of neurotechnologies compared with those of traditional therapies. An "evolutionary'' change can occur only by understanding in great detail the basic mechanisms of natural stroke recovery and technology-assisted neurorehabilitation. In this review, we first describe the results achieved by existing neurotechnologies and highlight their current limitations. In parallel, we summarize the data available on the mechanisms of recovery from electrophysiological, behavioral, and anatomical studies in humans and rodent models. Finally, we propose new approaches for the effective use of neurotechnologies in stroke survivors, as well as in people with other neurological disorders.

AB  - This study reveals the operating risk of cable breaking when the TMS-ROV recovery is carried out beneath rough ocean waves. To release the negative impact of the support vessels vertical heave motion on the station-keeping and position tracking performance of TMS, a robust hierarchical control scheme for a hydraulic-driven winch-based active heave compensation (AHC) system is proposed based on the combination of a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) strategy, an integral sliding mode control (ISMC) scheme and a vessel heave motion prediction algorithm. The motivation of utilizing the ISMC-based internal level combined with the integral state transformation technique is given by the robust capability to eliminate the uncertainties, which provides the nominal model for NMPC-based external level to guarantee the optimal evolution satisfying the state and input constraints and resisting the dynamical hysteresis caused by the employed extremely long cable length for deep-sea operation. Comparative simulation studies contribute to the analysis of the surge in cable tension during the TMS-ROV recovery and demonstrate the superior tracking and heave compensation performance, strong robustness and constraint satisfaction of the proposal.

AB  - Because of their unique adaptability, flexibility, and robustness, musculoskeletal robotic systems are regarded potentially as next-generation robots. However, motion learning and generation of such a robotic system are still challenging. This paper presents a neuromuscular control method, namely, TMS-PPO, based on time-varying muscle synergy (TMS) and proximal policy optimization (PPO). The electromyogram (EMG) activation signals of actual human motions are decomposed to obtain TMSs based on the temporal properties of the TMS. The weights of networks are trained to generate the scale and phase coefficients through the PPO. The coefficients modulate the TMSs to generate appropriate activation patterns to optimize motion learning of the musculoskeletal system. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the TMSs are extracted from human upper limb muscle activation signals, and we compare TMS-PPO with PPO in the motion learning and generation process of an upper limb musculoskeletal system. The results show that TMS-PPO can complete the control tasks because the average errors of the joints are less than 0.05 rad. In the meantime, TMSs are used as motion primitives of the musculoskeletal system to simulate the process of the human CNS controlling muscles. It shows that TMS-PPO reduces the energy consumption and improves the learning rate significantly compared with the PPO. The learning episodes reduce from 104 to 103, which indicates that TMS-PPO has a stronger learning ability and better physiological explanation.
   Note to Practitioners-Due to the superiorities of the musculoskeletal system, humanoid robots that imitate human driven mechanisms are vigorously carried out worldwide. Taking advantages of human-like characteristics, the musculoskeletal robot provides new opportunities to understand and validate the human mechanisms of muscle control and motion learning, to compare the performance of the robot to that of humans as well as work in real world, e.g., human interactive robots, amusement robots and medical training robots in the future. However, strong redundancy, coupling, and nonlinearity of the system also raises many challenges for the investigation of the control problem. Inspired by how the human CNS controls a musculoskeletal system and realize motion generalization, a novel muscle-synergiesbased neuromuscular control that combines time-varying muscle synergy (TMS) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), namely, TMS-PPO is proposed in this paper. The learning efficiency of PPO and the physiological interpretation of the control process are improved during the motion learning and generation processes of the musculoskeletal system. Preliminary simulation experiments suggest that this method is feasible in terms of control accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the performance of the TMS-PPO is comparable to the PPO without significant improvement. To solve this problem, in future work, we will introduce the cerebellar model into the control method which plays the role of adjusting and correcting the motions of the limbs to achieve accurate and stable control in the actions process of humans.

AB  - Purpose of Review Stroke is a common cause of disability in aging adults. A given individual's needs after stroke vary as a function of the stroke extent and location. The purpose of this review was to discuss recent clinical investigations addressing rehabilitation of an array of overlapping functional domains. Recent Findings Research is ongoing in the domains of movement, cognition, attention, speech, language, swallowing, and mental health. To best assist patients' recovery, innovative research has sought to develop and evaluate behavioral approaches, identify and refine synergistic approaches that augment the response to behavioral therapy, and integrate technology where appropriate, particularly to introduce and titrate real-world complexity and improve the overall experience of therapy. Recent and ongoing trials have increasingly adopted a multidisciplinary nature - augmenting refined behavioral therapy approaches with methods for increasing their potency, such as pharmaceutical or electrical interventions. The integration of virtual reality, robotics, and other technological advancements has generated immense excitement, but has not resulted in consistent improvements over more universally accessible, lower technology therapy.

AB  - Technological advancements in optoelectronic motion capture systems have allowed for the development of high-precision computer-assisted surgery (CAS) used in cranial and spinal surgical procedures. Errors generated sequentially throughout the chain of components of CAS may have cumulative effect on the accuracy of implant and instrumentation placement - potentially affecting patient outcomes. Navigational integrity and maintenance of fidelity of optoelectronic data is the cornerstone of CAS. Error reporting measures vary between studies. Understanding error generation, mechanisms of propagation, and how they relate to workflow can assist clinicians in error mitigation and improve accuracy during navigation in neurosurgical procedures. Diligence in planning, fiducial positioning, system registration, and intra-operative workflow have the potential to improve accuracy and decrease disparity between planned and final instrumentation and implant position. This study reviews the potential errors associated with each step in computer-assisted surgery and provides a basis for disparity in intrinsic accuracy versus achieved accuracy in the clinical operative environment.

AB  - A close-fitting assisted walking device (RE-Gait) designed to assist ankle movements might be a novel approach for acquiring the forefoot rocker function in the gait cycle. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of using RE-Gait by evaluating the intramuscular coherence (IMC) of the two parts of the tibialis anterior muscles (TA), which could indicate whether a common synaptic drive is present. Seventeen healthy volunteers walked on a treadmill at a comfortable speed before, during, and immediately after 15-minute RE-Gait intervention. After RE-Gait intervention, IMC of the two parts of the TA muscles in the beta frequency band in the initial swing phase was significantly enhanced during RE-Gait intervention. In addition, IMCs in the beta and low-gamma frequency bands were significantly correlated with the enhancement ratio of the step length. These results suggest that robotic ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion assistance in the initial swing phase may be effective for improving gait function with enhancement of the functioning of the sensorimotor loop.

AB  - The paper studies the directions of rehabilitation of patients who have suffered injuries of the musculoskeletal system. The author notes that rehabilitation of patients after injuries of the musculoskeletal system is a complex and multifaceted process that includes many approaches and techniques. Each patient has his own individual picture of the damage, so the approach to his treatment and rehabilitation should be individual and comprehensive. Modern rehabilitation methods, such as virtual reality, robotics, transcranial magnetic stimulation, Internet of Things technologies, stem cells and three-dimensional printing, provide new opportunities for effective rehabilitation of patients after injuries of the musculoskeletal system. However, it is important to remember that each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method should be based on the individual characteristics of the patient. In addition, psychological support and support of the relatives are equally important components of the rehabilitation process. It must be remembered that the process of recovery after injury of the musculoskeletal system can be long and difficult, and the support of others can significantly improve the quality of life of the patient and speed up the rehabilitation process.

AB  - Purpose Because of the sharply growing interest worldwide of "hard" physical-mechanical robot systems for the execution of on-site construction tasks [i.e. single-task construction robots (STCRs)], the purpose of this study is to equip development projects with a systematic design-management system model that allows to integrate the different needs and aims of stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach This paper proposes a STCR-technology management system (STCR-TMS) for the complete development cycle of STCR designs. The STCR-TMS is based on established principles from systems engineering and management and STCR-specific activities developed and tested by the authors as standalone elements in previous research work. Findings The application of the STCR-TMS revealed the practicability of the method and the underlying concepts to provide practical guidance for the development process. Additional findings indicate that the method is sufficiently generic and flexible for application to different types of robots and indifferent world regions. This research has also shown that key activities need to be addressed to increase the practicability of the STCR-TMS. Originality/value A unique characteristic of this method is the evolution with each utilization cycle. In addition, individual elements are interchangeable and can be adapted based on external circumstances. These properties allow the TMS to be applied to other fields in construction robotics. With the progression of the verification and validation of the method, know-how and certain elements can be fed into standardization activities (e.g. establishing a management system standard).

AB  - Most cases of hemiparetic cerebral palsy are caused by perinatal stroke, resulting in lifelong disability for millions of people. However, our understanding of how the motor system develops following such early unilateral brain injury is increasing. Tools such as neuroimaging and brain stimulation are generating informed maps of the unique motor networks that emerge following perinatal stroke. As a focal injury of defined timing in an otherwise healthy brain, perinatal stroke represents an ideal human model of developmental plasticity. Here, we provide an introduction to perinatal stroke epidemiology and outcomes, before reviewing models of developmental plasticity after perinatal stroke. We then examine existing therapeutic approaches, including constraint, bimanual and other occupational therapies, and their potential synergy with non-invasive neurostimulation. We end by discussing the promise of exciting new therapies, including novel neurostimulation, brain-computer interfaces and robotics, all focused on improving outcomes after perinatal stroke.
   In this article, Kirton et al. discuss our growing knowledge of the developmental plasticity that occurs after perinatal stroke and highlight the promise of emerging therapies, including non-invasive brain stimulation, brain-computer interfaces and robotics, that aim to modulate that plasticity.

AB  - More than half of stroke patients live with different levels of motor dysfunction after receiving routine rehabilitation treatments. Therefore, new rehabilitation technologies are urgently needed as auxiliary treatments for motor rehabilitation. Based on routine rehabilitation treatments, a new intelligent rehabilitation platform has been developed for accurate evaluation of function and rehabilitation training. The emerging intelligent rehabilitation techniques can promote the development of motor function rehabilitation in terms of informatization, standardization, and intelligence. Traditional assessment methods are mostly subjective, depending on the experience and expertise of clinicians, and lack standardization and precision. It is therefore difficult to track functional changes during the rehabilitation process. Emerging intelligent rehabilitation techniques provide objective and accurate functional assessment for stroke patients that can promote improvement of clinical guidance for treatment. Artificial intelligence and neural networks play a critical role in intelligent rehabilitation. Multiple novel techniques, such as brain-computer interfaces, virtual reality, neural circuit-magnetic stimulation, and robot-assisted therapy, have been widely used in the clinic. This review summarizes the emerging intelligent rehabilitation techniques for the evaluation and treatment of motor dysfunction caused by nervous system diseases.

AB  - Dysphagia, which refers to difficult and/or disordered swallowing, is a common problem associated with various neurological diseases such as stroke, motor neuron diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. Traditionally, dysphagia treatments are either compensatory, which includes modifications of bolus texture or feeding posture, or rehabilitative, which includes behavioral exercises and sensory stimulation. Despite being widely adopted in clinical practice, recent views have challenged the clinical efficacy of these treatments due to the low level of evidence supported by mainly non-controlled studies. As such, with advancements in technology and scientific research methods, recent times have seen a surge in the development of novel dysphagia treatments and an increasing number of robust randomized controlled clinical trials. In this review, we will review the clinical evidence of several newly introduced treatments for dysphagia in the last two decades, including rehabilitative exercises, biofeedback, pharmacological treatments, neuromodulation treatments and soft robotics. Despite the recent improvements in the quality of evidence for the efficacy of dysphagia treatments, several critical issues, including heterogeneity in treatment regimens, long-term treatment effects, underlying mechanisms of some neuromodulation treatments, and the effects of these techniques in non-stroke dysphagia, remain to be addressed in future clinical trials.

AB  - Independent control of movements between the fingers plays a role in hand dexterity characterizing skilled individuals. However, it remains unknown whether and in what manner neuromuscular and biomechanical constraints on the movement independence of the fingers depend on motor expertise. Here, we compared motor dexterity, corticospinal excitability of multiple muscles, muscular activation, and anatomical features of the fingers between the pianists and nonpianists. When the ring finger was passively moved by a robot, passive motions produced at the adjacent fingers were smaller for the pianists than the nonpianists, indicating reduced biomechanical constraint of fingers in the pianists. In contrast, when the ring finger moved actively, we found no group difference in passive motions produced at the adjacent fingers; however, reduced inhibition of corticospinal excitability of the adjacent fingers in the pianists compared with the nonpianists. This suggests strengthened neuromuscular coupling between the fingers of the pianists, enhancing the production of coordinated finger movements. These group differences were not evident during the index and little finger movements. Together, pianists show expertise-dependent biomechanical and neurophysiological adaptations, specifically at the finger with innately low movement independence. Such contrasting adaptations of pianists may subserve dexterous control of both the individuated and coordinated finger movements.

AB  - The cerebellum has demonstrated a critical role during adaptation in motor learning. However, the extent to which it can contribute to the skill acquisition of complex real-world tasks remains unclear. One particularly challenging application in terms of motor activities is robotic surgery, which requires surgeons to complete complex multidimensional visuomotor tasks through a remotely operated robot. Given the need for high skill proficiency and the lack of haptic feedback, there is a pressing need for understanding and improving skill development. We investigated the effect of cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation applied during the execution of a robotic surgery training task. Study participants received either real or sham stimulation while performing a needle driving task in a virtual (simulated) and a real-world (actual surgical robot) setting. We found that cerebellar stimulation significantly improved performance compared to sham stimulation at fast (more demanding) execution speeds in both virtual and real-world training settings. Furthermore, participants that received cerebellar stimulation more effectively transferred the skills they acquired during virtual training to the real world. Our findings underline the potential of non-invasive brain stimulation to enhance skill learning and transfer in real-world relevant tasks and, more broadly, its potential for improving complex motor learning.

AB  - Pediatric stroke (PS) is an injury caused by the occlusion or rupture of a blood vessel in the central nervous system (CNS) of children, before or after birth. Hemiparesis is the most common motoric deficit associated with PS in children. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that PS is a significant challenge for rehabilitation, especially since the consequences may also appear during the child's growth and development, reducing functional capacity. The plasticity of the child's CNS is an important predecessor of recovery, but disruption of the neural network, specific to an immature brain, can have harmful and potentially devastating consequences. In this review, we summarize the complexity of the consequences associated with PS and the possibilities and role of modern rehabilitation. An analysis of the current literature reveals that Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy, forced-use therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, functional electrical stimulation and robot-assisted therapy have demonstrated at least partial improvements in motor domains related to hemiparesis or hemiplegia caused by PS, but they are supported with different levels of evidence. Due to the lack of randomized controlled studies, the optimal rehabilitation treatment is still debatable, and therefore, most recommendations are primarily based on expert consensuses, opinions and an insufficient level of evidence.

AB  - In this proposal, order diminution of self-balanced linear-momentum based bicycle-robot (LMBR) controller is proposed with the help of time-moments (TMs) and Markovparameters (MPs) of higher-order (HO) LMBR controller and its desired reduced-order (RO) model by utilizing jaya algorithm. Firstly, the TMs and MPs of HO LMBR controller and its RO model are obtained. The TMs of HO LMBR controller and RO model are exploited for steady state matching. The MPs are utilized to construct the objective function which is weighted summation of errors in between MPs of HO LMBR controller and RO model. The framed objective function is minimized with the help of jaya algorithm. The minimization of errors between MPs of HO LMBR controller and RO model are done for ascertainment of unknown coefficients of desired RO model. The proposed RO model for HO LMBR controller is compared with the model obtained by exploiting other order reduction methods available in the literature.

AB  - Background: In this study, a novel electromechanical robotic exoskeleton was developed for the rehabilitation of distal joints. The objective was to explore the functional MRI and the neurophysiological changes in cortical-excitability in response to exoskeleton training for a 9-year chronic stroke patient.
   Case-Report: The study involved a 52-year old female patient with a 9-year chronic stroke of the right hemisphere, who underwent 20 therapy sessions of 45 min each. Cortical-excitability and clinical-scales: Fugl-Mayer (FM), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Brunnstrom-Stage (BS), Barthel-Index (BI), Range of Motion (ROM), were assessed pre-and post-therapy to quantitatively assess the motor recovery.
   Clinical Rehabilitation Impact: Increase in FM wrist/hand by 6, BI by 10, and decrease in MAS by 1 were reported. Ipsilesional Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) (obtained using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) was increased by 98 mu V with a decrease in RMT by 6% and contralesional MEP was increased by 43 mu V with a decrease in RMT by 4%. Laterality Index of Sensorimotor Cortex (SMC) reduced in precentral- gyrus (from 0.152 to -0.707) and in postcentral-gyrus (from 0.203 to -0.632).
   Conclusion: The novel exoskeleton-based training showed improved motor outcomes, cortical excitability, and neuronal activation. The research encourages the further investigation of the potential of exoskeleton training.

AB  - Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide despite recent advances in hyperacute interventions to lessen the initial impact of stroke. Stroke recovery therapies are crucial in reducing the long-term disability burden after stroke. Stroke recovery treatment options have rapidly expanded within the last decade, and we are in the dawn of an exciting era of multimodal therapeutic approaches to improve post-stroke recovery. In this narrative review, we highlighted various promising advances in treatment and technologies targeting stroke rehabilitation, including activity-based therapies, non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques, robotics-assisted therapies, brain-computer interfaces, pharmacological treatments, and cognitive therapies. These new therapies are targeted to enhance neural plasticity as well as provide an adequate dose of rehabilitation and improve adherence and participation. Novel activity-based therapies and telerehabilitation are promising tools to improve accessibility and provide adequate dosing. Multidisciplinary treatment models are crucial for post-stroke neurorehabilitation, and further adjuvant treatments with brain stimulation techniques and pharmacological agents should be considered to maximize the recovery. Among many challenges in the field, the heterogeneity of patients included in the study and the mixed methodologies and results across small-scale studies are the cardinal ones. Biomarker-driven individualized approaches will move the field forward, and so will large-scale clinical trials with a well-targeted patient population.

AB  - Detecting neuroplastic changes during locomotor neurorehabilitation is crucial for independent primal motor behaviours. However, long-term locomotor training-related neuroplasticity remains unexplored. We compared the effects of end-effector robot-assisted gait training (E-RAGT) and bodyweight-supported treadmill training (BWST) on cortical activation in individuals with hemiparetic stroke. Twenty-three men and five women aged 53.211.2 years were recruited and randomly assigned to participate in E-RAGT (n=14) or BWST (n=14) for 30 min/day, 5 days/week, for 4 weeks. Cortical activity, lower limb motor function, and gait speed were evaluated before and after training. Activation of the primary sensorimotor cortex, supplementary motor area, and premotor cortex in the affected hemisphere significantly increased only in the E-RAGT group, although there were no significant between-group differences. Clinical outcomes, including the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA), timed up and go test, and 10-m walk test scores, improved after training in both groups, with significantly better FMA scores in the E-RAGT group than in the BWST group. These findings suggest that E-RAGT effectively improves neuroplastic outcomes in hemiparetic stroke, although its superiority over conventional training remains unclear. This may have clinical implications and provides insight for clinicians interested in locomotor neurorehabilitation after hemiparetic stroke.p id=Par Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04054739 (12/08/2019).

AB  - Modelling humans' trust in robots is critical during human-robot interaction (HRI) to avoid under- or over-reliance on robots. Currently, it is challenging to calibrate trust in real-time. Consequently, we see limited work on calibrating humans' trust in robots in HRI. In this paper we describe a mathematical model that attempts to emulate the three-layered (initial, situational, learned) framework of trust capable of potentially estimating humans' trust in robots in real-time. We evaluated the trust model in an experimental setup that involved participants playing a trust game on four occasions. We validate the model based on linear regression analysis that showed that the trust perception score (TPS) and interaction session predicted the trust modelled score (TMS) computed by applying the trust model. We also show that TPS and TMS did not change significantly from the second to the fourth session. However, TPS and TMS captured in the last session increased significantly from the first session. The described work is an initial effort to model three layers of humans' trust in robot in a repeated HRI setup and requires further testing and extension to improve its robustness across settings.

AB  - Gallium-based liquid metals (LMs) are a group of metal materials that are in liquid state at room temperature. Their unique physiochemical properties such as fluidity, conductivity, and interfacial properties with other materials have presented great potentials and wide applications. Specifically, the interactions between gallium-based LMs and some common but important transition metals (TMs) have not only enabled a series of intriguing phenomena but also provided valuable strategies or functional materials in soft robotics, devices, flexible electronics, addictive manufacturing, biomedical engineering and therapies, and other fields. The chemical mechanisms including the galvanic corrosion, infiltration, intermetallic compound formation should play vital roles within these interactions. Hereby the combining the LMs and TMs by alloying or physically mixing may offer a platform to develop novel and multifunctional materials system. To acquire a comprehensive understanding of those interactions as well as to inspire the researches for multifunctional materials design and applications, this article reviews the researches on the combination of LMs and TMs, discusses the characteristics, the mechanisms, and their applications especially in electronics, smart materials, and biomedicine. The main challenges and future research outlook are also discussed.

AB  - This article focuses on the development of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) by utilizing advanced 2D nano-materials with innovative design and easy fabrication method to achieve durable TENG with high-power density and improved cycling performance. Herein, we fabricated a layer-by-layer stacked vertical contact-separation (CS) mode TENG. In this unique design, we incorporated a thin film of micron-sized Ti3C2Tx-MXene ultrathin sheets (TMSs) into a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) based tribo-negative electrode. A tribo-positive layer was prepared by integrating an optimized amount of NaCl into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix. After optimization of both triboelectric layers, the optimized TMS-TENG showed an open-circuit voltage (V-oc) similar to 390 V, short-circuit current (I-sc) similar to 96 mu A, and power density of 6.66 W center dot m(-2). The boosted performance is due to the synergistic effect of TMSs, used as a charge trapping layer on the electronegative side, and the impact of an NaCl:PVA impregnated layer on the electropositive side of the TENG. The ultrathin-layered structures of sandwiched TMS film serve bifunctionally as a charge accumulation and charge trapping entity simultaneously, increasing the charge separation due to high dielectric constant, and thus increasing the overall output power of the fabricated TENG. The prepared TMS-TENG was tested as a pressure sensor to monitor different sensitive physiological movements of the human body. Further applications of the designed TMS-TENGs have been revealed by powering more than 500 LEDs, an electronic calulator, and swiftly charging micro-capacitors by utilizing direct output power. By engineering electrodes, we can gain insight into the specific role that TMSs play in enhancing the performance of TENGs. This research provides a new avenue for designing self-powered pressure/motion sensors in robotics and harvesting biomechanical energy as electrical energy for sustainable electronics.

AB  - Robot-aided rehabilitation (RAR) and non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) are the two main interventions for post-stroke rehabilitation. The efficacy of both approaches in combination has not been well established yet. The importance of coupling these interventions, which both enhance brain plasticity to promote recovery, lies in augmenting the rehabilitation potential to constrain the limitation in daily living activities and the quality of life following stroke. This review aimed to evaluate the evidence of NIBS coupled with RAR in improving rehabilitation outcomes of upper limb and gait motor impairment in adult individuals with stroke. We included 18 clinical trials in this review. All studies were highly heterogeneous concerning the technical characteristics of robotic devices and NIBS protocols. However, the studies reported a global improvement in body structure and function and activity limitation for the upper limb, which were non-significant between the active and control groups. Concerning gait training protocols, the active group outperformed the control group in improving walking capacity and recovery. According to this review, NIBS and RAR in combination are promising but not yet largely recommendable as a systematic approach for stroke rehabilitation as there is not enough data about this. Therefore, more homogenous clinical trials are required, pointing out the best characteristics of the combined therapeutic protocols.

AB  - Objective: Unusual clinical courseBackground: Cervical spine deformities can occur because of genetic, congenital, inflammatory, degenerative, or iatrogenic causes.Case Report: We report a 45-year-old woman who presented to our clinic with complete paralysis of the left upper extrem-ity 5 months after C4-C6 discectomy and fusion surgery. The electrodiagnostic and EMG reports 3 months af-ter her previous surgery revealed left C5-C7 polyradiculopathy involving the upper trunk, lateral and posterior cords, and atrophy of the left deltoids, triceps, and biceps muscles. She underwent the following nerve transfer procedures with the senior author (RKN): The median nerve fascicles were transferred to the biceps and bra-chialis branches of the musculocutaneous nerve. Radial nerve triceps branches were transferred to the deltoid and teres minor branches of the axillary nerve. The patient could fully abduct her left shoulder to 170 degrees, and the LUE functions were restored to nearly normal 17 months after the surgery.Conclusions: Neurolysis combined with nerve transfer might be the most effective treatment for cervical spinal root inju-ries. Advances in peripheral nerve rewiring, transcranial magnetic stimulation, brain-computer interface robot-ic technologies, and emerging rehabilitation will undoubtedly increase the possibility of reviving the extremi-ties in patients with central pathology by restoring the descending motor signals through the residual neural network connections.

AB  - It is likely that when using an artificially augmented hand with six fingers, the natural five plus a robotic one, corticospinal motor synergies controlling grasping actions might be different. However, no direct neurophysiological evidence for this reasonable assumption is available yet. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex to directly address this issue during motor imagery of objects' grasping actions performed with or without the Soft Sixth Finger (SSF). The SSF is a wearable robotic additional thumb patented for helping patients with hand paresis and inherent loss of thumb opposition abilities. To this aim, we capitalized from the solid notion that neural circuits and mechanisms underlying motor imagery overlap those of physiological voluntary actions. After a few minutes of training, healthy humans wearing the SSF rapidly reshaped the pattern of corticospinal outputs towards forearm and hand muscles governing imagined grasping actions of different objects, suggesting the possibility that the extra finger might rapidly be encoded into the user's body schema, which is integral part of the frontal-parietal grasping network. Such neural signatures might explain how the motor system of human beings is open to very quickly welcoming emerging augmentative bioartificial corticospinal grasping strategies. Such an ability might represent the functional substrate of a final common pathway the brain might count on towards new interactions with the surrounding objects within the peripersonal space. Findings provide a neurophysiological framework for implementing augmentative robotic tools in humans and for the exploitation of the SSF in conceptually new rehabilitation settings.

AB  - There is no consensus about the definition or most effective treatment for neglect syndrome. The aim of this review was therefore to evaluate the results of trials that investigated different treatment methods for neglect syndrome. A systematic literature search in PubMed and Web of Science databases was performed to identify studies that investigated the effects of neglect therapies. Authors followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Studies were selected by two assayers, and disagreement was resolved by a third reviewer. The literature search identified 202 articles: 19 met the inclusion criteria and were included for data extraction. Thirty-five different kinds of assessments were used in these studies, and 17 treatment methods were applied. Successful treatments were reported at least in some parts of the assessments in 12 studies: mirror therapy (in two trials), transcranial magnetic stimulation, street crossing test in virtual reality, smooth pursuit eye movement training, saccadic eye movement therapy, direct current stimulation, eye patching therapy, prism adaptation treatment, socially assistive pet-type therapeutic robot (PARO), Kinesiological Instrument for Normal and Altered Reaching Movement robotic device therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and optokinetic stimulation (the last two methods in the same trial). No success was shown in seven trials, which contained not only single treatments but combined ones also. Authors concluded that there are no convincing results for or against any of the different therapies used for neglect syndrome. The quality of the trials is questionable, and the numbers of included patients are small in the trials.

AB  - Non-progressive conditions that develop in the growing fetus or newborn brain and result in lifelong motor impairments and activity restrictions are collectively referred to as cerebral palsy. In the present review, recent advancements in the treatment of cerebral palsy are discussed. Studies are currently being conducted on high-tech aids such as telemedicine, robotics, virtual reality, telerehabilitation, and exoskeletons. In the current review, we focus on the effectiveness of interventions including neurologic music therapy, aquatic therapy, virtual reality, robotics, electrical stimulation, constraint-induced movement therapy, hippotherapy, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. We also discuss the drugs used for the treatment of spasticity in cerebral palsy, as well as the effects of nutritional intake. Neurologic music therapy alongside physiotherapy leads to positive rehabilitation outcomes, as does treadmill gait training combined with robotics for lower limb improvements. Furthermore, kinesio taping is helpful for positioning the wrist, thumb, and fingers, and for reducing upper limb stiffness. Neurorestorative therapies such as cell therapy, brain-computer interface technology, and transcranial magnetic stimulation may also effectively restore neural networks in a positive direction in cerebral palsy. Finally, rehabilitation along with neurofeedback and biofeedback is considered helpful in patients with this neurological disorder. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - There are now a large number of technological and methodological approaches to the rehabilitation of motor function after stroke. It is important to employ these approaches in a manner that is tailored to specific patient impairments and desired functional outcomes, while avoiding the hype of overly broad or unsubstantiated claims for efficacy. Here we review the evidence for poststroke plasticity, including therapy-related plasticity and functional imaging data. Early demonstrations of remapping in somatomotor and somatosensory representations have been succeeded by findings of white matter plasticity and a focus on activity-dependent changes in neuronal properties and connections. The methods employed in neurorehabilitation have their roots in early understanding of neuronal circuitry and plasticity, and therapies involving large numbers of repetitions, such as robotic therapy and constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), change measurable nervous systems properties. Other methods that involve stimulation of brain and peripheral excitable structures have the potential to harness neuroplastic mechanisms, but remain experimental. Gaps in our understanding of the neural substrates targeted by neurorehabilitation technology and techniques remain, preventing their prescriptive application in individual patients as well as their general refinement. However, with ongoing research-facilitated in part by technologies that can capture quantitative information about motor performance-this gap is narrowing. These research approaches can improve efforts to attain the shared goal of better functional recovery after stroke.

AB  - Background Some forms of movement disorders are characterized by task-specific manifestations of symptoms. However, its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we addressed this issue through a novel motor adaptation experimental paradigm. Methods Pianists with and without focal task-specific dystonia learned to play the piano with a key whose weight can be modified by a novel robot system. Results The result clearly demonstrated a significantly larger error between the target and produced keystroke velocities in the patients than the controls following a repetition of keystrokes of the weighted key. This adaptation failure was not correlated with the variability of timing and velocity of the keystroke when the patients were playing unloaded piano keys, which suggests distinct effects of focal task-specific dystonia on motor adaptation and fine motor control. Immediately after a repetition of the strikes of the heavy key with keeping the fingers adducted, the error of the keystroke velocity when striking the key with the fingers more abducted was maintained in both the patients and controls. This generalization of the adaptation across different hand postures suggests that motor memory of dynamics of the piano key is independent of biomechanical properties of the hand. Importantly, a lack of difference in the finger muscular strength between the groups indicated that the adaptation failure was not attributed to deficit of muscular strength in the patients. Conclusions These findings suggest that task-specific manifestation of dystonic movements in focal task-specific dystonia is associated with malfunctions of internal representation of mechanical properties of a well-trained tool.

AB  - Background:& nbsp;The technological intervention is considered as an adjunct to the conventional therapies applied in the rehabilitation session. In most high-income countries, technology has been widely used in assisting stroke survivors to undergo their treatments. However, technology use is still lacking in Southeast Asia, especially in middle- and low-income countries. This scoping review identifies and summarizes the technologies and related gaps available in Southeast Asia pertaining to stroke rehabilitation.& nbsp;Methods:& nbsp;The JBI manual for evidence synthesis was used to conduct a scoping study. Until September 2021, an electronic search was performed using four databases (Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, ASEAN Citation Index). Only the studies that were carried out in Southeast Asia were chosen.& nbsp;Results:& nbsp;Forty-one articles were chosen in the final review from 6,873 articles found during the initial search. Most of the studies reported the implementation of technological intervention combined with conventional therapies in stroke rehabilitation. Advanced and simple technologies were found such as robotics, virtual reality, telerehabilitation, motion capture, assistive devices, and mobility training from Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The majority of the studies show that technological interventions can enhance the recovery period of stroke survivors. The consultation session suggested that the technological interventions should facilitate the needs of the survivors, caregivers, and practitioners during the rehabilitation.& nbsp;Conclusions:& nbsp;The integration of technology into conventional therapies has shown a positive outcome and show significant improvement during stroke recovery. Future studies are recommended to investigate the potential of home-based technological intervention and lower extremities.

AB  - Advances in medical diagnosis and treatment have facilitated the emergence of precision medicine. In contrast, locomotor rehabilitation for individuals with acquired neuromotor injuries remains limited by the dearth of (i) diagnostic approaches that can identify the specific neuromuscular, biomechanical, and clinical deficits underlying impaired locomotion and (ii) evidence-based, targeted treatments. In particular, impaired propulsion by the paretic limb is a major contributor to walking-related disability after stroke; however, few interventions have been able to target deficits in propulsion effectively and in a manner that reduces walking disability. Indeed, the weakness and impaired control that is characteristic of post-stroke hemiparesis leads to heterogeneous deficits that impair paretic propulsion and contribute to a slow, metabolically-expensive, and unstable gait. Current rehabilitation paradigms emphasize the rapid attainment of walking independence, not the restoration of normal propulsion function. Although walking independence is an important goal for stroke survivors, independence achieved via compensatory strategies may prevent the recovery of propulsion needed for the fast, economical, and stable gait that is characteristic of healthy bipedal locomotion. We posit that post-stroke rehabilitation should aim to promote independent walking, in part, through the acquisition of enhanced propulsion. In this expert review, we present the biomechanical and functional consequences of post-stroke propulsion deficits, review advances in our understanding of the nature of post-stroke propulsion impairment, and discuss emerging diagnostic and treatment approaches that have the potential to facilitate new rehabilitation paradigms targeting propulsion restoration.

AB  - Objective: To compare the effects of unilateral, proximal arm robot-assisted therapy combined with hand functional electrical stimulation with intensive conventional therapy for restoring arm function in survivors of subacute stroke.
   Design: This was a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: Inpatient rehabilitation university hospital.
   Participants: Patients (N=40) diagnosed as having ischemic stroke (time since stroke <8wk) and upper limb impairment were enrolled.
   Interventions: Participants randomized to the experimental group received 30 sessions (5 sessions/wk) of robot-assisted arm therapy and hand functional electrical stimulation (RAT+FES). Participants randomized to the control group received a time-matched intensive conventional therapy.
   Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was arm motor recovery measured with the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment. Secondary outcomes included motor function, arm spasticity, and activities of daily living. Measurements were performed at baseline, after 3 weeks, at the end of treatment, and at 6-month follow-up. Presence of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) was also measured at baseline.
   Results: Both groups significantly improved all outcome measures except for spasticity without differences between groups. Patients with moderate impairment and presence of MEPs who underwent early rehabilitation (<30d post stroke) demonstrated the greatest clinical improvements.
   Conclusions: RAT+FES was no more effective than intensive conventional arm training. However, at the same level of arm impairment and corticospinal tract integrity, it induced a higher level of arm recovery. (C) 2019 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine

AB  - Background
   Robot-assisted therapy and noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) are promising strategies for stroke rehabilitation.
   Objective
   This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the evidence of NIBS as an add-on intervention to robotic therapy in order to improve outcomes of upper-limb motor impairment or activity in individuals with stroke.
   Methods
   This study was performed according to the PRISMA Protocol and was previously registered on the PROSPERO Platform (CRD42017054563). Seven databases and gray literature were systematically searched by 2 reviewers, and 1176 registers were accessed. Eight randomized clinical trials with upper-limb body structure/function or activity limitation outcome measures were included. Subgroup analyses were performed according to phase poststroke, device characteristics (ie, arm support, joints involved, unimanual or bimanual training), NIBS paradigm, timing of stimulation, and number of sessions. The Grade-Pro Software was used to assess quality of the evidence.
   Results
   A nonsignificant homogeneous summary effect size was found both for body structure function domain (mean difference [MD] = 0.15; 95% CI = -3.10 to 3.40; P = 0.93; I-2 = 0%) and activity limitation domain (standard MD = 0.03; 95% CI = -0.28 to 0.33; P = 0.87; I-2 = 0%).
   Conclusions
   According to this systematic review and meta-analysis, at the moment, there are not enough data about the benefits of NIBS as an add-on intervention to robot-assisted therapy on upper-limb motor function or activity in individuals with stroke.

AB  - Stroke is among the most common causes of adult disability worldwide, and its disease burden is shifting towards that of a long-term condition. Therefore, the development of approaches to enhance recovery and augment neural repair after stroke will be critical. Recovery after stroke involves complex interrelated systems of neural repair. There are changes in both structure (at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels) and function (in terms of excitability, cortical maps, and networks) that occur spontaneously within the brain. Several approaches to augment neural repair through enhancing these changes are under study. These include identifying novel drug targets, implementing rehabilitation strategies, and developing new neurotechnologies. Each of these approaches has its own array of different proposed mechanisms. Current investigation has emphasized both cellular and circuit-based targets in both gray and white matter, including axon sprouting, dendritic branching, neurogenesis, axon preservation, remyelination, blood brain barrier integrity, blockade of extracellular inhibitory signals, alteration of excitability, and promotion of new brain cortical maps and networks. Herein, we review for clinicians recovery after stroke, basic elements of spontaneous neural repair, and ongoing work to augment neural repair. Future study requires alignment of basic, translational, and clinical research. The field continues to grow while becoming more clearly defined. As thrombolysis changed stroke care in the 1990 s and thrombectomy in the 2010 s, the augmentation of neural repair and recovery after stroke may revolutionize care for these patients in the coming decade.

AB  - Stroke affects one out of every six people on Earth. Approximately 90% of stroke survivors have some functional disability with mobility being a major impairment, which not only affects important daily activities but also increases the likelihood of falling. Originally intended to supplement traditional post-stroke gait rehabilitation, robotic systems have gained remarkable attention in recent years as a tool to decrease the strain on physical therapists while increasing the precision and repeatability of the therapy. While some of the current methods for robot-assisted rehabilitation have had many positive and promising outcomes, there is moderate evidence of improvement in walking and motor recovery using robotic devices compared to traditional practice. In order to better understand how and where robot-assisted rehabilitation has been effective, it is imperative to identify the main schools of thought that have prevailed. This review intends to observe those perspectives through three different lenses: the goal and type of interaction, the physical implementation, and the sensorimotor pathways targeted by robotic devices. The ways that researchers approach the problem of restoring gait function are grouped together in an intuitive way. Seeing robot-assisted rehabilitation in this unique light can naturally provoke the development of new directions to potentially fill the current research gaps and eventually discover more effective ways to provide therapy. In particular, the idea of utilizing the human inter-limb coordination mechanisms is brought up as an especially promising area for rehabilitation and is extensively discussed.

AB  - In this contribution, order reduction of self-balanced-bicycle-robot (SBBR) controller is proposed by incorporating rank-order-centroid (ROC) based method utilizing grey-wolf-optimizer. The higher-order (HO) SBBR controller system is approximated by minimizing the errors between time-moments (TMs) and Markov-parameters (MPs) of HO SBBR system and desired approximated-model. The minimization of errors are accomplished by framing the weighted objective function utilizing TMs and MPs. The weights are associated with the weighted objective function. These weights are determined by systematic procedure of ROC based method. The main orientation of this proposal is to ascertain the associated weights in a systematic manner exploiting ROC method by providing the appropriate importance to effect-on-steady-state response and effect-on-transient response for SBBR controller based robotic application. The minimization of weighted objective function is done for the determination of unknown coefficients of approximant with the help of grey-wolf-optimizer. The optimization is done by employing matching of first TMs of the HO system and approximated-model ensuring the steady-state-matching. In this approximation, the stability of desired approximant is also ensured with the help of Hurwitz stability criterion. The obtained approximant is compared with already available controller models for SBBR in the literature. The step and impulse along with error and Bode responses are plotted to show the efficacy and productiveness of proposed method. The time-domain-analysis and performance-error-criterion-analysis are also provided in the support of proposed methodology.

AB  - Background. An ischemic stroke is followed by the remapping of motor representation and extensive changes in cortical excitability involving both hemispheres. Although stimulation of the ipsilesional motor cortex, especially when paired with motor training, facilitates plasticity and functional restoration, the remapping of motor representation of the single and combined treatments is largely unexplored. Objective. We investigated if spatio-temporal features of motor-related cortical activity and the new motor representations are related to the rehabilitative treatment or if they can be specifically associated to functional recovery. Methods. We designed a novel rehabilitative treatment that combines neuro-plasticizing intervention with motor training. In detail, optogenetic stimulation of peri-infarct excitatory neurons expressing Channelrhodopsin 2 was associated with daily motor training on a robotic device. The effectiveness of the combined therapy was compared with spontaneous recovery and with the single treatments (ie optogenetic stimulation or motor training). Results. We found that the extension and localization of the new motor representations are specific to the treatment, where most treatments promote segregation of the motor representation to the peri-infarct region. Interestingly, only the combined therapy promotes both the recovery of forelimb functionality and the rescue of spatio-temporal features of motor-related activity. Functional recovery results from a new excitatory/inhibitory balance between hemispheres as revealed by the augmented motor response flanked by the increased expression of parvalbumin positive neurons in the peri-infarct area. Conclusions. Our findings highlight that functional recovery and restoration of motor-related neuronal activity are not necessarily coupled during post-stroke recovery. Indeed the reestablishment of cortical activation features of calcium transient is distinctive of the most effective therapeutic approach, the combined therapy.

AB  - Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, affecting ambulation even in people with only mild neurological signs. Patients with MS frequently experience spasticity, which contributes significantly to impair their motor functions, including ambulation, owing to muscle stiffness, spasms, and pain.
   Objectives: To clarify the role of delta-9tetrahydrocannabinol(THC):cannabidiol(CBD) oromucosal spray, coupled to robot-aided gait training (RAGT) using the Lokomat (c) Pro to improve functional ambulation in patients with MS.
   Methods: We compared 20 patients with MS, who were treated with THC:CBD oromucosal spray in add-on to the ongoing oral antispastic therapy (OAT) (group A), with 20 individuals with MS (matched for clinical-demographic characteristics) who were treated only with OAT (group B). Both the groups underwent RAGT using the Lokomat-Pro (three 45-minute sessions per week). Our primary outcome measures were the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and the 10 meters walking test (10MWT). As secondary outcome measures we evaluated the brain cortical excitability by using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Both parameters were taken before and after the end of the RAGT.
   Results: FIM improved in group A more than in group B (p<0.001). Moreover, 10MWT decreased in group A more than in group B (p<0.001). These clinical findings were paralleled by a more evident reshape of intracortical excitability in both upper and lower limbs, as suggested by motor evoked potential amplitude increase (p<0.001), intracortical inhibition strengthening (p<0.001), and intracortical facilitation decrease (p=0.01) in group A as compared to group B.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that the combined THC:CBD-RAGT approach could be useful in improving gait performance in patients with MS.

AB  - Background: Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a group of inheritance diseases resulting in gait abnormalities, which may be detected using instrumented gait analysis. The aim of this systematic review was 2-fold: to identify specific gait analysis patterns and interventions improving gait in HSP subjects.Methods: A systematic review was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, REHABDATA, and PEDro databases, in accordance with reporting guidelines of PRISMA statement and Cochrane's recommendation. The review protocol was recorded on the PROSPERO register. Patients with pure and complicated HSP of any age were included. All types of studies were included. Risk of bias, quality assessment, and meta-analysis were performed.Results: Forty-two studies were included: 19 were related to gait analysis patterns, and 24 were intervention studies. The latter ones were limited to adults. HSP gait patterns were similar to cerebral palsy in younger subjects and stroke in adults. Knee hyperextension, reduced range of motion at knee, ankle, and hip, reduced foot lift, and increased rapid trunk and arm movements were reported. Botulinum injections reduced spasticity but uncovered weakness and improved gait velocity at follow-up. Weak evidence supported intrathecal baclofen, active intensive physical therapy (i.e., robot-assisted gait training, functional exercises, and hydrotherapy), and functional electrical stimulation. Some improvements but adverse events were reported after transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation, and spinal cord stimulation implant.Conclusion: Knee hyperextension, non-sagittal pelvic movements, and reduced ROM at the knee, ankle, and hip represent the most peculiar patterns in HSP, compared to diplegic cerebral palsy and stroke. Botulinum improved comfortable gait velocity after 2 months. Nonetheless, interventions reducing spasticity might result in ineffective functional outcomes unveiling weakness. Intensive active physical therapy and FES might improve gait velocity in the very short term.

AB  - Brain stimulation using noninvasive methods has been widely adopted in neuropsychiatric disorder therapies. Clinicians who use the innovative methods situate the stimulator manually in a typical setup. However, this causes practical difficulties in precisely locating the stimulation device at a desired pose. This article proposes a robotic positioning system that can precisely position a brain stimulation device at the desired pose. The design concepts are focused on the development of a system with a workspace specialized in noninvasive brain stimulation. To stimulate the overall area around the upper part of the head, the system is designed to have a specific posture with a six-degrees- of-freedom (6-DOF) movable parallel mechanism and a 1-DOF extra revolute joint. The combined system not only significantly increases the workspace of the system but also increases its physical safety. In the movable parallel mechanism, we realize sufficient mobility for the robotic device using three- (P) over bar RPS chains ((P) over bar : curved prismatic joint, R: revolute joint, P: prismatic joint, and S: spherical joint). The curved prismatic joint ((P) over bar) is a revolute joint realized by curved rail and enables efficient movement of the stimulator around the subject's head. Furthermore, the parallel mechanism offers good physical safety and load-carrying capacity. The moving platform, which is close to the head, exhibits low inertia, and there is no rapid change in the acceleration due to the failure of control because the moving platform is moved as a combination of joint movements. The system can accommodate stimulators of varying weights, such as those employing transcranial magnetic stimulation and ultrasound transducers. A prototype of the proposed system was developed using the design specifications, and its performance was verified experimentally.

AB  - Background: Injuries to the neuromusculoskeletal system often result in weakness and gait impairments. Functional resistance training during walking-where patients walk while a device increases loading on the leg-is an emerging approach to combat these symptoms. However, there are many methods that can be used to resist the patient, which may alter the biomechanics of the training. Thus, all methods may not address patient-specific deficits. Methods: We performed a comprehensive electronic database search to identify articles that acutely (i.e., after a single training session) examined how functional resistance training during walking alters muscle activation, gait biomechanics, and neural plasticity. Only articles that examined these effects during training or following the removal of resistance (i.e., aftereffects) were included. Findings: We found 41 studies that matched these criteria. Most studies (24) used passive devices (e.g., weighted cuffs or resistance bands) while the remainder used robotic devices. Devices varied on if they were wearable (14) or externally tethered, and the type of resistance they applied (i.e., inertial [14], elastic [8], viscous [7], or customized [12]). Notably, these methods provided device-specific changes in muscle activation, biomechanics, and spatiotemporal and kinematic aftereffects. Some evidence suggests this training results in task-specific increases in neural excitability. Interpretation: These findings suggest that careful selection of resistive strategies could help target patient-specific strength deficits and gait impairments. Also, many approaches are low-cost and feasible for clinical or in-home use. The results provide new insights for clinicians on selecting an appropriate functional resistance training strategy to target patient-specific needs.

AB  - Neuroanatomical investigations have associated cortical areas, beyond Primary Somatosensory Cortex (S1), with impaired proprioception. Cortical regions have included temporoparietal (TP) regions (supramarginal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, Heschl's gyrus) and insula. Previous approaches have struggled to account for concurrent damage across multiple brain regions. Here, we used a targeted lesion analysis approach to examine the impact of specific combinations of cortical and sub-cortical lesions and quantified the prevalence of proprioceptive impairments when different regions are damaged or spared. Seventy-seven individuals with stroke (49 male; 28 female) were identified meeting prespecified lesion criteria based on MRI/CT imaging: 1) TP lesions without S1, 2) TP lesions with S1, 3) isolated S1 lesions, 4) isolated insula lesions, and 5) lesions not impacting these regions (other regions group). Initially, participants meeting these criteria (1-4) were grouped together into right or left lesion groups and compared to each other, and the other regions group (5), on a robotic Arm Position Matching (APM) task and a Kinesthesia (KIN) task. We then examined the behaviour of individuals that met each specific criteria (groups 1-5). Proprioceptive impairments were more prevalent following right hemisphere lesions than left hemisphere lesions. The extent of damage to TP regions correlated with performance on both robotic tasks. Even without concurrent S1 lesions, TP and insular lesions were associated with impairments on the APM and KIN tasks. Finally, lesions not impacting these regions were much less likely to result in impairments. This study highlights the critical importance of TP and insular regions for accurate proprioception. Significance statement: This work advances our understanding of the neuroanatomy of human proprioception. We validate the importance of regions, beyond the dorsal column medial lemniscal pathway and S1, for proprioception. Further, we provide additional evidence of the importance of the right hemisphere for human proprioception. Improved knowledge on the neuroanatomy of proprioception is crucial for advancing therapeutic approaches which target individuals with proprioceptive impairments following neurological injury or with neurological disorders.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this scoping review was to explore the current treatment approaches for patients with post-stroke unilateral spatial neglect. Methods A three-step search strategy using the Johanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines, was undertaken. PubMed, CINAHL, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, SCOPUS, PROSPERO, JBI, Sport Discus, and Google Scholar databases were searched. Searches were limited to publications from January 1, 2008, to May 1, 2020. Critical appraisal was undertaken by two independent reviewers using a standardized critical appraisal instrument developed by JBI. Data were extracted using a study-specific charting table. Results A total of 3,648 articles were identified, 311 full-text articles were screened and 86 articles were critically appraised, with 83 articles included in the review. Intervention approaches for post-stroke unilateral spatial neglect symptom amelioration were identified and categorized as prism adaptation and visual scanning, mental practice and mirror therapy, electrical stimulation and robotics, combination therapy, pharmacological therapy, and other interventions. Both positive and negative results across identified interventions were identified without specific reference to the phase of recovery. Conclusion This review provides insight into current interventions for post-stroke unilateral spatial neglect. A plethora of intervention studies have been explored to ameliorate neglect symptoms post-stroke.IMPLICATION FOR REHABILITATION Prism adaptation (PA) and combination therapy are most commonly investigated intervention for unilateral spatial neglect (USN) and showed promise in ameliorating USN symptoms. No single treatment approach seems optimally superior in the rehabilitation of USN post-stroke. Evidence for the selection of treatment at a specific phase of recovery is not conclusive as both positive and negative outcome on neglect measure were observed across all treatment approaches without specific reference to the phase of recovery. Evidence for the long-term use of PA in USN rehabilitation appears to be modest.

AB  - Background: Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) creates a state with increased excitability that permits treatment modalities to induce neuroplasticity and motor learning. Continuous theta burst stimulation before iTBS may induce metaplasticity and boost the facilitatory effect of iTBS. This study investigated the effects of priming iTBS (ie, applying continuous theta burst stimulation before iTBS) on poststroke hemiparetic upper limb recovery.
   Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 42 patients with chronic stroke were recruited and randomly allocated to 10 sessions of either priming iTBS, nonpriming iTBS, or sham stimulation to the ipsilesional motor cortex, immediately before robot-assisted training. Outcomes included Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity, Action Research Arm Test and mean movement velocity during each robot-assisted training session. Twenty-one patients were enrolled for measuring the sensorimotor beta event-related desynchronization induced by either mirror visual feedback or movement.
   Results: The Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity scores revealed a significant time-by-group interaction (P=0.011). Priming and nonpriming iTBS were both superior to sham stimulation in post hoc comparisons; however, the superiority was diminished at follow-up. Among patients with a higher functioning upper limb, priming iTBS yielded a significantly greater improvement in Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity scores than nonpriming iTBS (P=0.025) and sham stimulation (P=0.029) did. No significant interaction was found when analyzing the Action Research Arm Test and mean movement velocity. Priming iTBS enhanced the patients' mirror visual feedback-induced high beta sensorimotor event-related desynchronization over their ipsilesional hemisphere.
   Conclusions: Priming and nonpriming iTBS are both superior to sham stimulation in enhancing treatment gains from robot-assisted training, and patients with a higher functioning upper limb may experience more benefits from priming iTBS. Priming iTBS may facilitate poststroke motor learning by enhancing the permissiveness of the ipsilesional sensorimotor area to therapeutic sensory modalities, such as the mirror visual feedback.

AB  - Robot-assisted rehabilitation (RAR) and non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) are interventions that, both individually and combined, can significantly enhance motor performance after spinal cord injury (SCI). We sought to determine whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with active transvertebral direct current stimulation (tvDCS) (namely, NIBS) in association with RAR (RAR + NIBS) improves lower extremity motor function more than RAR alone in subjects with motor incomplete SCI (iSCI). Fifteen adults with iSCI received one daily session of RAR+NIBS in the early afternoon, six sessions weekly, for eight consecutive weeks. Outcome measures included the 6 min walk test (6MWT), the 10 m walk test (10MWT), the timed up and go (TUG) to test mobility and balance, the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI II), the Functional Independence Measure-Locomotion (FIM-L), the manual muscle testing for lower extremity motor score (LEMS), the modified Ashworth scale for lower limbs (MAS), and the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. The data of these subjects were compared with those of 20 individuals matched for clinical and demographic features who previously received the same amount or RAR without NIBS (RAR - NIBS). All patients completed the trial, and none reported any side effects either during or following the training. The 10MWT improved in both groups, but the increase was significantly greater following RAR + NIBS than RAR - NIBS. The same occurred for the FIM-L, LEMS, and WISCI II. No significant differences were appreciable concerning the 6MWT and TUG. Conversely, RAR - NIBS outperformed RAR + NIBS regarding the MAS and VAS. Pairing tvDCS with rTMS during RAR can improve lower extremity motor function more than RAR alone can do. Future research with a larger sample size is recommended to determine longer-term effects on motor function and activities of daily living.

AB  - Brain-computer interface-assisted motor imagery (MI-BCI) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been proven effective in post-stroke motor function enhancement, yet whether the combination of MI-BCI and tDCS may further benefit the rehabilitation of motor functions remains unknown. This study investigated brain functional activity and connectivity changes after a 2 week MI-BCI and tDCS combined intervention in 19 chronic subcortical stroke patients. Patients were randomized into MI-BCI with tDCS group and MI-BCI only group who underwent 10 sessions of 20 min real or sham tDCS followed by 1 h MI-BCI training with robotic feedback. We derived amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity (FC) from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data pre- and post-intervention. At baseline, stroke patients had lower ALFF in the ipsilesional somatomotor network (SMN), lower ReHo in the contralesional insula, and higher ALFF/Reho in the bilateral posterior default mode network (DMN) compared to age-matched healthy controls. After the intervention, the MI-BCI only group showed increased ALFF in contralesional SMN and decreased ALFF/Reho in the posterior DMN. In contrast, no post-intervention changes were detected in the MI-BCI + tDCS group. Furthermore, higher increases in ALFF/ReHo/FC measures were related to better motor function recovery (measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment scores) in the MI-BCI group while the opposite association was detected in the MI-BCI + tDCS group. Taken together, our findings suggest that brain functional re-normalization and network-specific compensation were found in the MI-BCI only group but not in the MI-BCI + tDCS group although both groups gained significant motor function improvement post-intervention with no group difference. MI-BCI and tDCS may exert differential or even opposing impact on brain functional reorganization during post-stroke motor rehabilitation; therefore, the integration of the two strategies requires further refinement to improve efficacy and effectiveness.

AB  - Trial and error motor adaptation has been linked to somatosensory plasticity and shifts in proprioception (limb position sense). The role of sensory processing in motor skill learning is less understood. Unlike adaptation, skill learning involves the acquisition of new movement patterns in the absence of perturbation, with performance limited by the speed-accuracy trade-off. We investigated somatosensory changes during motor skill learning at the behavioral and neurophysiological levels. Twenty-eight healthy young adults practiced a maze-tracing task, guiding a robotic manipulandum through an irregular twodimensional track featuring several abrupt turns. Practice occurred on days I and 2. Skill was assessed before practice on day 1 and again on day 3, with learning indicated by a shift in the speed-accuracy function between these assessments. Proprioceptive function was quantified with a passive two-alternative forced-choice task. In a subset of 15 participants, we measured short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) to index somatosensory projections to motor cortex. We found that motor practice enhanced the speed-accuracy skill function (F-4,F-108 = 32.15, P < 0.001) and was associated with improved proprioceptive sensitivity at retention (t(22) = 24.75, P = 0.0031). Furthermore, SAI increased after training (F-1,F-14 = 5.41, P = 0.036). Interestingly, individuals with larger increases in SAI, reflecting enhanced somatosensory afference to motor cortex, demonstrated larger improvements in motor skill learning. These.findings suggest that SA-.1 may he an important functional mechanism for some aspect of motor skill learning. Further research is needed to test what parameters (task complexity, practice time, etc.) are specifically linked to somatosensory function.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Somatosensory processing has been implicated in motor adaptation, where performance recovers from a perturbation such as a force field. We investigated somatosensory function during motor skill learning, where a new motor pattern is acquired in the absence of perturbation. After skill practice, we found changes in proprioception and short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), signifying somatosensory change at both the behavioral and neurophysiological levels. SAI may he an important functional mechanism by which individuals learn motor skills.

AB  - The Stroop task is a well-established tool to investigate the influence of competing visual categories on decision making. Neuroimaging as well as rTMS studies have demonstrated the involvement of parietal structures, particularly the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), in this task. Given its reliability, the numerical Stroop task was used to compare the effects of different TMS targeting approaches by Sack and colleagues (Sack AT 2009), who elegantly demonstrated the superiority of individualized fMRI targeting. We performed the present study to test whether fMRI-guided rTMS effects on numerical Stroop task performance could still be observed while using more advanced techniques that have emerged in the last decade (e.g., electrical sham, robotic coil holder system, etc.). To do so we used a traditional reaction time analysis and we performed, post-hoc, a more advanced comprehensive drift diffusion modeling approach. Fifteen participants performed the numerical Stroop task while active or sham 10 Hz rTMS was applied over the region of the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) showing the strongest functional activation in the Incongruent > Congruent contrast. This target was determined based on individualized fMRI data collected during a separate session. Contrary to our assumption, the classical reaction time analysis did not show any superiority of active rTMS over sham, probably due to confounds such as potential cumulative rTMS effects, and the effect of practice. However, the modeling approach revealed a robust effect of rTMS on the drift rate variable, suggesting differential processing of congruent and incongruent properties in perceptual decision-making, and more generally, illustrating that more advanced computational analysis of performance can elucidate the effects of rTMS on the brain where simpler methods may not.

AB  - Chronic stroke patients with upper-limb motor disabilities are now beginning to see treatment options that were not previously available. To date, the two options recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration include vagus nerve stimulation and brain-computer interface therapy. While the mechanisms for vagus nerve stimulation have been well defined, the mechanisms underlying brain-computer interface-driven motor rehabilitation are largely unknown. Given that cross-frequency coupling has been associated with a wide variety of higher-order functions involved in learning and memory, we hypothesized this rhythm-specific mechanism would correlate with the functional improvements effected by a brain-computer interface. This study investigated whether the motor improvements in chronic stroke patients induced with a brain-computer interface therapy are associated with alterations in phase-amplitude coupling, a type of cross-frequency coupling. Seventeen chronic hemiparetic stroke patients used a robotic hand orthosis controlled with contralesional motor cortical signals measured with EEG. Patients regularly performed a therapeutic brain-computer interface task for 12 weeks. Resting-state EEG recordings and motor function data were acquired before initiating brain-computer interface therapy and once every 4 weeks after the therapy. Changes in phase-amplitude coupling values were assessed and correlated with motor function improvements. To establish whether coupling between two different frequency bands was more functionally important than either of those rhythms alone, we calculated power spectra as well. We found that theta-gamma coupling was enhanced bilaterally at the motor areas and showed significant correlations across brain-computer interface therapy sessions. Importantly, an increase in theta-gamma coupling positively correlated with motor recovery over the course of rehabilitation. The sources of theta-gamma coupling increase following brain-computer interface therapy were mostly located in the hand regions of the primary motor cortex on the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Beta-gamma coupling decreased bilaterally at the frontal areas following the therapy, but these effects did not correlate with motor recovery. Alpha-gamma coupling was not altered by brain-computer interface therapy. Power spectra did not change significantly over the course of the brain-computer interface therapy. The significant functional improvement in chronic stroke patients induced by brain-computer interface therapy was strongly correlated with increased theta-gamma coupling in bihemispheric motor regions. These findings support the notion that specific cross-frequency coupling dynamics in the brain likely play a mechanistic role in mediating motor recovery in the chronic phase of stroke recovery.
   Rustamov et al. report that theta-gamma coupling enhanced bilaterally at the motor regions following brain-computer interface therapy showing a positive correlation with motor recovery. These findings imply that specific cortical cross-frequency coupling dynamics likely play a mechanistic role in mediating motor recovery in chronic stroke.

AB  - Background: Stroke is a leading cause of lifelong disability worldwide, partially driven by a reduced ability to use the upper limb in daily life causing increased dependence on caregivers. However, post-stroke functional impairments have only been investigated using limited clinical scores, during short-term longitudinal studies in relatively small patient cohorts. With the addition of technology-based assessments, we propose to complement clinical assessments with more sensitive and objective measures that could more holistically inform on upper limb impairment recovery after stroke, its impact on upper limb use in daily life, and on overall quality of life. This paper describes a pragmatic, longitudinal, observational study protocol aiming to gather a uniquely rich multimodal database to comprehensively describe the time course of upper limb recovery in a representative cohort of 400 Asian adults after stroke. Particularly, we will characterize the longitudinal relationship between upper limb recovery, common post-stroke impairments, functional independence and quality of life.Methods: Participants with stroke will be tested at up to eight time points, from within a month to 3 years post-stroke, to capture the influence of transitioning from hospital to community settings. We will perform a battery of established clinical assessments to describe the factors most likely to influence upper limb recovery. Further, we will gather digital health biomarkers from robotic or wearable sensing technology-assisted assessments to sensitively characterize motor and somatosensory impairments and upper limb use in daily life. We will also use both quantitative and qualitative measures to understand health-related quality of life. Lastly, we will describe neurophysiological motor status using transcranial magnetic stimulation.Statistics: Descriptive analyses will be first performed to understand post-stroke upper limb impairments and recovery at various time points. The relationships between digital biomarkers and various domains will be explored to inform key aspects of upper limb recovery and its dynamics using correlation matrices. Multiple statistical models will be constructed to characterize the time course of upper limb recovery post-stroke. Subgroups of stroke survivors exhibiting distinct recovery profiles will be identified.Conclusion: This is the first study complementing clinical assessments with technology-assisted digital biomarkers to investigate upper limb sensorimotor recovery in Asian stroke survivors. Overall, this study will yield a multimodal data set that longitudinally characterizes post-stroke upper limb recovery in functional impairments, daily-life upper limb use, and health-related quality of life in a large cohort of Asian stroke survivors. This data set generates valuable information on post-stroke upper limb recovery and potentially allows researchers to identify different recovery profiles of subgroups of Asian stroke survivors. This enables the comparisons between the characteristics and recovery profiles of stroke survivors in different regions. Thus, this study lays out the basis to identify early predictors for upper limb recovery, inform clinical decision-making in Asian stroke survivors and establish tailored therapy programs.

AB  - Restoration of underwater images plays a vital role in underwater target detection and recognition, underwater robots, underwater rescue, sea organism monitoring, marine geological survey, and real-time navigation. Mostly, physics-based optimization methods do not incorporate structural differences between the guidance and transmission maps (TMs) which affect the performance. In this paper, we propose a method for underwater image restoration by utilizing a robust regularization of coherent structures. The proposed method incorporates the potential structural differences between TM and the guidance map. The optimization of TM is modeled through a nonconvex energy function which consists of data and smoothness terms. The initial TM is taken as a data term whereas the smoothness term contains static and dynamic structural priors. Finally, the optimization problem is solved using majorize-minimize (MM) algorithm. The proposed method is tested on benchmark dataset and its performance is compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The results from the experiments indicate that the proposed regularization scheme adequately improves the TM, which results in high-quality restored images.

AB  - This work proposes a safety-critical local reactive controller that enables the robot to navigate in unknown and cluttered environments. In particular, the trajectory tracking task is formulated as a constrained polynomial optimization problem. Then, safety constraints are imposed on the control variables invoking the notion of polynomial positivity certificates in conjunction with their Sum-of-Squares (SOS) approximation, thereby confining the robot motion inside the locally extracted convex free region. It is noteworthy that, in the process of devising the proposed safety constraints, the geometry of the robot can be approximated using any shape that can be characterized with a set of polynomial functions. The optimization problem is further convexified into a semidefinite program (SDP) leveraging truncated multi-sequences (TMS) and moment relaxation, which favorably facilitates the effective use of off-the-shelf conic programming solvers, such that real-time performance is attainable. Various robot navigation tasks are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of safety and tracking performance.

AB  - Communicative gaze (e.g., mutual or averted) has been shown to affect attentional orienting. However, no study to date has clearly separated the neural basis of the pure social component that modulates attentional orienting in response to communicative gaze from other processes that might be a combination of attentional and social effects. We used TMS to isolate the purely social effects of communicative gaze on attentional orienting. Participants completed a gaze-cueing task with a humanoid robot who engaged either in mutual or in averted gaze before shifting its gaze. Before the task, participants received either sham stimulation (baseline), stimulation of right TPJ (rTPJ), or dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Results showed, as expected, that communicative gaze affected attentional orienting in baseline condition. This effect was not evident for rTPJ stimulation. Interestingly, stimulation to rTPJ also canceled out attentional orienting altogether. On the other hand, dmPFC stimulation eliminated the socially driven difference in attention orienting between the two gaze conditions while maintaining the basic general attentional orienting effect. Thus, our results allowed for separation of the pure social effect of communicative gaze on attentional orienting from other processes that are a combination of social and generic attentional components.

AB  - Dedicated fieldbuses were developed to provide temporal determinisms for industrial distributed real-time systems. In the early stages, communication systems were dedicated to a single protocol and generally supported a single service. Industrial Ethernet, which is used today, supports many concurrent services, but usually only one real-time protocol at a time. However, shop-floor communication must support a range of different traffic from messages with strict real-time requirements such as time-driven messages with process data and event-driven security messages to diagnostic messages that have more relaxed temporal requirements. Thus, it is necessary to combine different real-time protocols into one communication network. This raises many challenges, especially when the goal is to use wireless communication. There is no research work on that area and this paper attempts to fill in that gap. It is a result of some experiments that were conducted while connecting a Collaborative Robot CoBotAGV with a production station for which two real-time protocols, Profinet and OPC UA, had to be combined into one wireless network interface. The first protocol was for the exchange of processing data, while the latter integrated the vehicle with Manufacturing Execution System (MES) and Transport Management System (TMS). The paper presents the real-time capabilities of such a combination-an achievable communication cycle and jitter.

AB  - Humans are inherently social beings that benefit from their perceptional capability to embody another point of view, typically referred to as perspective taking. Perspective taking is an essential feature in our daily interactions and is pivotal for human development. However, much remains unknown about the precise mechanisms that underlie perspective taking. Here, we show that formalizing perspective taking in a computational model can detail the embodied mechanisms employed by humans in perspective taking. The model's main building block is a set of action primitives that are passed through a forward model. The model employs a process that selects a subset of action primitives to be passed through the forward model to reduce the response time. The model demonstrates the results that mimic those captured by human data, including response times differences caused by the angular disparity between the perspective-taker and the other agent, the impact of task-irrelevant body posture variations in perspective taking, and differences in the perspective taking strategy between individuals. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that perspective taking is a mental simulation of the physical movements that are required to match another person's visual viewpoint. Furthermore, the model provides several testable predictions, including the prediction that forced early responses lead to an egocentric bias and that a selection process introduces dependencies between two consecutive trials. Our results indicate potential links between perspective taking and other essential perceptional and cognitive mechanisms, such as active vision and autobiographical memories.

AB  - Previous work shows that in some instances artificial agents, such as robots, can elicit higher-order socio-cognitive mechanisms, similar to those elicited by humans. This suggests that these socio-cognitive mechanisms, such as mentalizing processes, originally developed for interaction with other humans, might be flexibly (re-)used, or "hijacked", for approaching this new category of interaction partners (Wykowska, 2020). In this study, we set out to identify neural markers of such flexible reuse of socio-cognitive mechanisms. We focused on fronto-parietal theta synchronization, as it has been proposed to be a substrate of cognitive flexibility in general (Fries, 2005). We analyzed EEG data from two experiments (Bossi et al., 2020; Roselli et al., submitted), in which participants completed a test measuring their individual likelihood to adopt the intentional stance towards robots, the intentional stance (IST) test. Our results show that participants with higher scores on the IST, indicating that they had higher likelihood of adopting the intentional stance towards a robot, had a significantly higher theta synchronization value, relative to participants with lower scores on the IST. These results suggest that long-range synchronization in the theta band might be a marker sociocognitive process that can be flexibly applied towards non-human agents, such as robots.

AB  - 4D printing of smart materials is a viable field of research for fabricating dynamic structures for various biomedical applications. 4D printing of hydrogel structures is challenging due to poor printability of hydrogels and poor shape fidelity of printed patterns when direct-ink writing-based 3D printers are used. In this study, chitosan (CS) hydrogel ink cross-linked with citric acid (CA) was made printable, exhibiting a shape-morphing behaviour when exposed to solvent as an external trigger. As one side of a printed structure is exposed to solvent, the solvent diffuses in and a concentration gradient is developed across the section. This concentration gradient results in displacement field, which finally leads to out-of-plane bending of the structure. This actuation is irreversible in nature since the concentration gradient is maintained between hydrophilic chitosan and hydrophobic silane layers. The reversibility of the morphed structures was achieved by dipping them in ethanol, which takes up solvent over time and thus diminishes the concentration gradient.The optimized CS/CA ink exhibited excellent rheological properties, with good extrudability and shape fidelity of printed structures. The chitosan ink was printed into various complex 3D architectures and was modified by hydrophobic coating of trimethyl silane (TMS). These hydrophobic patterns were coated on printed structures with varied interspacing, angles, and hinges to generate programmable designs. A printed soft gripper was demonstrated as an application that could lift an object seven times its weight. The shape morphing CS/CA hydrogel with excellent printability exhibits potential for 4D printing that has wide applications in soft robots, actuators, grippers, and sensors.

AB  - In Underwater exploration, umbilical cord or tether cables are used to provide data transfer, electrical power and control commands to underwater robots and surface vessels. Umbilicals are also useful for anchoring, mooring, and for the deployment of underwater sensors. In general, tethers are naturally buoyant and are designed to work under rough sea conditions and is managed via the Tether Management Systems(TMS). In a limited-size environment such as nuclear environment inspection, multiple ROVs may be deployed and due to the density of various objects underwater, tangles and loops tend to form in low-tension zones due to residual torsion and flexure. The formation of tangles could hinder the operation of the ROV, and attenuate signal transmission in fibre-optic cables due to formed knots and kinks on the cables. Moreover, the risk of collection and entanglements is even increased if the ROV is equipped with manipulators that may tangle with the tether. In this paper, a novel robotics tether system is developed that is capable of navigating in the water to prevent loops and tangles and avoid obstacles. The developments of the system is a bio-inspired design that mimics the motion of a snake in the water. The design of the system single unit consists of a double mu thrust system that is designed to be fitted on the tether. The developed system is distributed in the form of sections on the tether cable. The mu thruster implement a specific pulse thrust according to the distance from an object to prevent collection and entanglement. To effectively simulate the proposed system, a tether cable is simulated for three types of cases, traditional tether, constant thrust tether and constant thrust with wave pattern. Moreover, the initial experiments in the hydrodynamics lab tank showed efficient locomotion of the tether cable away from obstacles.

AB  - Light touch with an earth-fixed reference point improves balance during quite standing. In our current study, we implemented a paradigm to assess the effects of disrupting the right posterior parietal cortex on dynamic stabilization of body sway with and without Light Touch after a graded, unpredictable mechanical perturbation. We hypothesized that the benefit of Light Touch would be amplified in the more dynamic context of an external perturbation, reducing body sway and muscle activations before, at and after a perturbation. Furthermore, we expected sway stabilization would be impaired following disruption of the right Posterior Parietal Cortex as a result of increased postural stiffness. Thirteen young adults stood blindfolded in Tandem-Romberg stance on a force plate and were required either to keep light fingertip contact to an earth-fixed reference point or to stand without fingertip contact. During every trial, a robotic arm pushed a participant's right shoulder in medio-lateral direction. The testing consisted of 4 blocks before TMS stimulation and 8 blocks after, which alternated between Light Touch and No Touch conditions. In summary, we found a strong effect of Light Touch, which resulted in improved stability following a perturbation. Light Touch decreased the immediate sway response, steady state sway following re-stabilization, as well as muscle activity of the Tibialis Anterior. Furthermore, we saw gradual decrease of muscle activity over time, which indicates an adaptive process following exposure to repetitive trials of perturbations. We were not able to confirm our hypothesis that disruption of the rPPC leads to increased postural stiffness. However, after disruption of the rPPC, muscle activity of the Tibialis Anterior is decreased more compared to sham. We conclude that rPPC disruption enhanced the intra-session adaptation to the disturbing effects of the perturbation.

AB  - The chemical nature, the number length of integrated building blocks, as well as their sequence structure impact the phase morphology of multiblock copolymers (MBC) consisting of two non-miscible block types. We hypothesized that a strictly alternating sequence should favour phase segregation and in this way the elastic properties. A library of well-defined MBCs composed of two different hydrophobic, semi-crystalline blocks providing domains with well-separated melting temperatures (T(m)s) were synthesized from the same type of precursor building blocks as strictly alternating (MBCsalt) or random (MBCsran) MBCs and compared. Three different series of MBCsalt or MBCsran were synthesized by high-throughput synthesis by coupling oligo(e-caprolactone) (OCL) of different molecular weights (2, 4, and 8 kDa) with oligotetrahydrofuran (OTHF, 2.9 kDa) via Steglich esterification in which the molar ratio of the reaction partners was slightly adjusted. Maximum of weight average molecular weight (M-w) were 65,000 g center dot mol(-1), 165,000 g center dot mol(-1), and 168,000 g center dot mol(-1) for MBCsalt and 80,500 g center dot mol(-1), 100,000 g center dot mol(-1), and 147,600 g center dot mol(-1) for MBCsran. When Mw increased, a decrease of both Tms associated to the melting of the OCL and OTHF domains was observed for all MBCs. T-m (OTHF) of MBCsran was always higher than Tm (OTHF) of MBCsalt, which was attributed to a better phase segregation. In addition, the elongation at break of MBCsalt was almost half as high when compared to MBCsran. In this way this study elucidates role of the block length and sequence structure in MBCs and enables a quantitative discussion of the structure-function relationship when two semi-crystalline block segments are utilized for the design of block copolymers.

AB  - Background: Thigh muscle weakness after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) can persist after returning to activity. While resistance training can improve muscle function, "nonfunctional" training methods are not optimal for inducing transfer of benefits to activities such as walking. Here, we tested the feasibility of a novel functional resistance training (FRT) approach to restore strength and function in an individual with ACLR.
   Hypothesis: FRT would improve knee strength and function after ACLR.
   Study Design: Case report.
   Methods: A 15-year-old male patient volunteered for an 8-week intervention where he performed 30 minutes of treadmill walking, 3 times per week, while wearing a custom-designed knee brace that provided resistance to the thigh muscles of his ACLR leg. Thigh strength, gait mechanics, and corticospinal and spinal excitability were assessed before and immediately after the 8-week intervention. Voluntary muscle activation was evaluated immediately after the intervention.
   Results: Knee extensor and flexor strength increased in the ACLR leg from pre- to posttraining (130 to 225 N.m [+74%] and 44 to 88 N.m [+99%], respectively) and increases in between-limb extensor and flexor strength symmetry (45% to 92% [+74%] and 47% to 72% [+65%], respectively) were also noted. After the intervention, voluntary muscle activation in the ACLR leg was 72%, compared with the non-ACLR leg at 75%. Knee angle and moment during late stance phase decreased (ie, improved) in the ACLR leg and appeared more similar to the non-ACLR leg after FRT training (18 degrees to 14 degrees [-23.4] and 0.07 to -0.02 N.m.kg(-1).m(-1) [-122.8%], respectively). Corticospinal and spinal excitability in the ACLR leg decreased (3511 to 2511 [-28.5%] and 0.42 to 0.24 [-43.7%], respectively) from pre- to posttraining.
   Conclusion: A full 8 weeks of FRT that targeted both quadriceps and hamstring muscles lead to improvements in strength and gait, suggesting that FRT may constitute a promising and practical alternative to traditional methods of resistance training.
