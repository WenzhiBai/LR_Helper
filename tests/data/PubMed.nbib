AB  - This article is based on a consensus conference, promoted and supported by the 
      International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN), which took place in 
      Siena (Italy) in October 2018. The meeting intended to update the ten-year-old 
      safety guidelines for the application of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) 
      in research and clinical settings (Rossi et al., 2009). Therefore, only emerging 
      and new issues are covered in detail, leaving still valid the 2009 
      recommendations regarding the description of conventional or patterned TMS 
      protocols, the screening of subjects/patients, the need of neurophysiological 
      monitoring for new protocols, the utilization of reference thresholds of 
      stimulation, the managing of seizures and the list of minor side effects. New 
      issues discussed in detail from the meeting up to April 2020 are safety issues of 
      recently developed stimulation devices and pulse configurations; duties and 
      responsibility of device makers; novel scenarios of TMS applications such as in 
      the neuroimaging context or imaging-guided and robot-guided TMS; TMS interleaved 
      with transcranial electrical stimulation; safety during paired associative 
      stimulation interventions; and risks of using TMS to induce therapeutic seizures 
      (magnetic seizure therapy). An update on the possible induction of seizures, 
      theoretically the most serious risk of TMS, is provided. It has become apparent 
      that such a risk is low, even in patients taking drugs acting on the central 
      nervous system, at least with the use of traditional stimulation parameters and 
      focal coils for which large data sets are available. Finally, new operational 
      guidelines are provided for safety in planning future trials based on traditional 
      and patterned TMS protocols, as well as a summary of the minimal training 
      requirements for operators, and a note on ethics of neuroenhancement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Up to 50% of the nearly 800,000 patients who experience a new or 
      recurrent stroke each year in the United States fail to achieve full independence 
      afterward. More effective approaches to enhance motor recovery following stroke 
      are needed. This article reviews the rehabilitative principles and strategies 
      that can be used to maximize post-stroke recovery. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: Evidence 
      dictates that mobilization should not begin prior to 24 hours following stroke, 
      but detailed guidelines beyond this are lacking. Specific classes of potentially 
      detrimental medications should be avoided in the early days poststroke. Patients 
      with stroke who are unable to return home should be referred for evaluation to an 
      inpatient rehabilitation facility. Research suggests that a substantial increase 
      in both the dose and intensity of upper and lower extremity exercise is 
      beneficial. A clinical trial supports vagus nerve stimulation as an adjunct to 
      occupational therapy for motor recovery in the upper extremity. The data remain 
      somewhat mixed as to whether robotics, transcranial magnetic stimulation, 
      functional electrical stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation 
      are better than dose-matched traditional exercise. No current drug therapy has 
      been proven to augment exercise poststroke to enhance motor recovery. ESSENTIAL 
      POINTS: Neurologists will collaborate with rehabilitation professionals for 
      several months following a patient's stroke. Many questions still remain about 
      the ideal exercise regimen to maximize motor recovery in patients poststroke. The 
      next several years will likely bring a host of new research studies exploring the 
      latest strategies to enhance motor recovery using poststroke exercise.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis is a slowly progressive disease, immunosuppressants and other 
      drugs can delay the progression and progression of the disease, but the most 
      patients will be left with varying degrees of neurological deficit symptoms, such 
      as muscle weakness, muscle spasm, ataxia, sensory impairment, dysphagia, 
      cognitive dysfunction, psychological disorders, etc. From the early stage of the 
      disease to the stage of disease progression, professional rehabilitation 
      treatment can reduce the functional dysfunction of multiple sclerosis patients, 
      improve neurological function, and reduce family and social burdens. With the 
      development of various new rehabilitation technologies such as transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation, virtual reality technology, robot-assisted gait, 
      telerehabilitation and transcranial direct current stimulation, the advantages of 
      rehabilitation therapy in multiple sclerosis treatment have been further 
      established, and more treatment means have also been provided for patients.

TI  - Clinical Benefit of Rehabilitation Training in Spinal Cord Injury: A Systematic 
      Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - E398-E410
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000003789 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: This study was 
      performed to evaluate the effects of different rehabilitation interventions in 
      spinal cord injury. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several activity-based 
      interventions have been widely applied in spinal cord injury in the past, but the 
      effects of these rehabilitation exercises are controversial. METHODS: 
      Publications were searched from databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, the database 
      of the U.S. National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization 
      International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) using the searching terms like 
      spinal cord injury, transcranial magnetic stimulation, functional electrical 
      stimulation, activity-based therapy, and robotic-assisted locomotor training. 
      Randomized controlled trials and controlled trials were included. The primary 
      outcomes included functional upper/lower extremity independence, walking 
      capacity, spasticity, and life quality of individuals with spinal cord injury. 
      Meta-analysis was performed using Revman 5.0 software. RESULTS: Thirty-one 
      articles were included. Meta-analysis showed that transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation improved walking speed (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01, 0.16) and 
      lower extremity function (95% CI 1.55, 7.27); functional electrical stimulation 
      significantly increased upper extremity independence (95% CI 0.37, 5.48). 
      Robotic-assisted treadmill training improved lower extremity function (95% CI 
      3.44, 6.56) compared with related controls. CONCLUSION: Activity-based 
      intervention like transcranial magnetic stimulation, functional electrical 
      stimulation, and robotic-assisted treadmill training are effective in improving 
      function in individuals with spinal cord injury.Level of Evidence: 1.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for neuropathic pain: a randomized 
      multicentre sham-controlled trial.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been proposed to treat 
      neuropathic pain but the quality of evidence remains low. We aimed to assess the 
      efficacy and safety of neuronavigated rTMS to the primary motor cortex (M1) or 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in neuropathic pain over 25 weeks. We 
      carried out a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at four 
      outpatient clinics in France. Patients aged 18-75 years with peripheral 
      neuropathic pain were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to M1 or DLPFC-rTMS and 
      rerandomized at a 2:1 ratio to active or sham-rTMS (10 Hz, 3000 pulses/session, 
      15 sessions over 22 weeks). Patients and investigators were blind to treatment 
      allocation. The primary end point was the comparison between active M1-rTMS, 
      active DLPCF-rTMS and sham-rTMS for the change over the course of 25 weeks (Group 
      × Time interaction) in average pain intensity (from 0 no pain to 10 maximal pain) 
      on the Brief Pain Inventory, using a mixed model repeated measures analysis in 
      patients who received at least one rTMS session (modified intention-to-treat 
      population). Secondary outcomes included other measures of pain intensity and 
      relief, sensory and affective dimensions of pain, quality of pain, self-reported 
      pain intensity and fatigue (patients diary), Patient and Clinician Global 
      Impression of Change (PGIC, CGIC), quality of life, sleep, mood and 
      catastrophizing. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02010281. A 
      total of 152 patients were randomized and 149 received treatment (49 for M1; 52 
      for DLPFC; 48 for sham). M1-rTMS reduced pain intensity versus sham-rTMS 
      (estimate for Group × Session interaction: -0.048 ± 0.02; 95% CI: -0.09 to -0.01; 
      P = 0.01). DLPFC-rTMS was not better than sham (estimate: -0.003 ± 0.01; 95% CI: 
      -0.04 to 0.03, P = 0.9). M1-rRMS, but not DLPFC-rTMS, was also superior to 
      sham-rTMS on pain relief, sensory dimension of pain, self-reported pain intensity 
      and fatigue, PGIC and CGIC. There were no effects on quality of pain, mood, sleep 
      and quality of life as all groups improved similarly over time. Headache was the 
      most common side effect and occurred in 17 (34.7%), 23 (44.2%) and 13 (27.1%) 
      patients from M1, DLPFC and sham groups, respectively (P = 0.2). Our results 
      support the clinical relevance of M1-rTMS, but not of DLPFC-rTMS, for peripheral 
      neuropathic pain with an excellent safety profile.

TI  - Evidence of neuroplasticity with robotic hand exoskeleton for post-stroke 
      rehabilitation: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 76
LID - 10.1186/s12984-021-00867-7 [doi]
LID - 76
AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel electromechanical robotic-exoskeleton was designed in-house 
      for the rehabilitation of wrist joint and Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. 
      OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare the rehabilitation effectiveness 
      (clinical-scales and neurophysiological-measures) of robotic-therapy training 
      sessions with dose-matched conventional therapy in patients with stroke. METHODS: 
      A pilot prospective parallel randomized controlled study at clinical settings was 
      designed for patients with stroke within 2 years of chronicity. Patients were 
      randomly assigned to receive an intervention of 20 sessions of 45 min each, five 
      days a week for four weeks, in Robotic-therapy Group (RG) (n = 12) and 
      conventional upper-limb rehabilitation in Control-Group (CG) (n = 11). We 
      intended to evaluate the effects of a novel exoskeleton based therapy on the 
      functional rehabilitation outcomes of upper-limb and cortical-excitability in 
      patients with stroke as compared to the conventional-rehabilitation. 
      Clinical-scales- Modified Ashworth Scale, Active Range of Motion, Barthel-Index, 
      Brunnstrom-stage and Fugl-Meyer (FM) scale and neurophysiological measures of 
      cortical-excitability (using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) -Motor Evoked 
      Potential and Resting Motor threshold, were acquired pre- and post-therapy. 
      RESULTS: No side effects were noticed in any of the patients. Both RG and CG 
      showed significant (p < 0.05) improvement in all clinical motor-outcomes except 
      Modified Ashworth Scale in CG. RG showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher 
      improvement over CG in Modified Ashworth Scale, Active Range of Motion and 
      Fugl-Meyer scale and FM Wrist-/Hand component. An increase in 
      cortical-excitability in ipsilesional-hemisphere was found to be statistically 
      significant (p < 0.05) in RG over CG, as indexed by a decrease in Resting Motor 
      Threshold and increase in the amplitude of Motor Evoked Potential. No significant 
      changes were shown by the contralesional-hemisphere. Interhemispheric 
      RMT-asymmetry evidenced significant (p < 0.05) changes in RG over CG indicating 
      increased cortical-excitability in ipsilesional-hemisphere along with 
      interhemispheric changes. CONCLUSION: Robotic-exoskeleton training showed 
      improvement in motor outcomes and cortical-excitability in patients with stroke. 
      Neurophysiological changes in RG could most likely be a consequence of plastic 
      reorganization and use-dependent plasticity. Trial registry number: 
      ISRCTN95291802.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) motor mapping can 
      characterize the neurophysiology of the motor system. Limitations including human 
      error and the challenges of pediatric populations may be overcome by emerging 
      robotic systems. We aimed to show that neuronavigated robotic motor mapping in 
      adolescents could efficiently produce discrete maps of individual upper extremity 
      muscles, the characteristics of which would correlate with motor behavior. 
      METHODS: Typically developing adolescents (TDA) underwent neuronavigated robotic 
      TMS mapping of bilateral motor cortex. Representative maps of first dorsal 
      interosseous (FDI), abductor pollicis brevis (APB), and abductor digiti minimi 
      (ADM) muscles in each hand were created. Map features including area (primary), 
      volume, and center of gravity were analyzed across different excitability regions 
      (R100%, R75%, R50%, R25%). Correlations between map metrics and validated tests 
      of hand motor function (Purdue Pegboard Test as primary) were explored. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-four right-handed participants (range 12-18 years, median 15.5 years, 52% 
      female) completed bilateral mapping and motor assessments with no serious adverse 
      events or dropouts. Gender and age were associated with hand function and motor 
      map characteristics. Full motor maps (R100%) for FDI did not correlate with motor 
      function in either hand. Smaller excitability subset regions demonstrated reduced 
      variance and dose-dependent correlations between primary map variables and motor 
      function in the dominant hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS: Hand function in TDA correlates 
      with smaller subset excitability regions of robotic TMS motor map outcomes. 
      Refined motor maps may have less variance and greater potential to quantify 
      interventional neuroplasticity. Robotic TMS mapping is safe and feasible in 
      adolescents.

TI  - Differences in neurometabolites and transcranial magnetic stimulation motor maps 
      in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - E239-E249
LID - 10.1503/jpn.210186 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although much is known about cognitive dysfunction in 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), few studies have examined the 
      pathophysiology of disordered motor circuitry. We explored differences in 
      neurometabolite levels and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-derived 
      corticomotor representations among children with ADHD and typically developing 
      children. METHODS: We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) protocols to 
      measure excitatory (glutamate + glutamine [Glx]) and inhibitory (γ-aminobutyric 
      acid [GABA]) neurometabolite levels in the dominant primary motor cortex (M1) and 
      the supplementary motor area (SMA) in children with ADHD and typically developing 
      children. We used robotic neuronavigated TMS to measure corticospinal 
      excitability and create corticomotor maps. RESULTS: We collected data from 26 
      medication-free children with ADHD (aged 7-16 years) and 25 typically developing 
      children (11-16 years). Children with ADHD had lower M1 Glx (p = 0.044, d = 0.6); 
      their mean resting motor threshold was lower (p = 0.029, d = 0.8); their map area 
      was smaller (p = 0.044, d = 0.7); and their hotspot density was higher (p = 
      0.008, d = 0.9). M1 GABA levels were associated with motor map area (p = 
      0.036).Limitations: Some TMS data were lost because the threshold of some 
      children exceeded 100% of the machine output. The relatively large MRS voxel 
      required to obtain sufficient signal-to-noise ratio and reliably measure GABA 
      levels encompassed tissue beyond the M1, making this measure less anatomically 
      specific. CONCLUSION: The neurochemistry and neurophysiology of key nodes in the 
      motor network may be altered in children with ADHD, and the differences appear to 
      be related to each other. These findings suggest potentially novel 
      neuropharmacological and neuromodulatory targets for ADHD.

AB  - Disorders of Consciousness are a big challenge for the entire process of 
      rehabilitation: assessment, diagnosis, pharmacological, and rehabilitation 
      programs, including conventional treatments and the use of new technologies. 
      Causes of Disorders of Consciousness may vary from stroke to traumatic brain 
      injury to post-anoxic or metabolic brain damage; but all Disorders of 
      Consciousness are in fact a wide spectrum of clinical syndromes from vegetative 
      state (recently named unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) to minimally conscious 
      state and they may be a transitory event as well as persistent conditions. The 
      most correct diagnosis possible is important for prognosis, adequate, and 
      tailored rehabilitation planning. We primarily consider the current available 
      evidences on behavioral scales for the assessment of clinical presentation of 
      Disorders of Consciousness because they still are the most important step in 
      diagnosis of Disorders of Consciousness; then we describe the evidences on 
      instrumental means for diagnosis, from EEG to fMRI and ERP. The second part of 
      the chapter is focused on recent rehabilitation evidences and recommendation on 
      therapeutic interventions from early rehabilitation treatments to specific 
      treatments for spasticity or to the use of new technologies such as repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and 
      robotic devices.

AB  - Robotic transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive and safe tool 
      that produces cortical motor maps using neuronavigational and neuroanatomical 
      images. Motor maps are individualized representations of the primary motor cortex 
      (M1) topography that may reflect developmental and interventional plasticity. 
      Results of TMS motor map reliability testing have been variable, and robotic 
      measures are undefined. We aimed to determine the short- and long-term 
      reliability of robotic TMS motor maps. Twenty healthy participants underwent 
      motor mapping at baseline, 24 h, and 4 wk. A 12 × 12 grid (7-mm spacing) was 
      placed over the left M1, centered over the hand knob area. Four suprathreshold 
      stimulations were delivered at each grid point. First dorsal interosseous (FDI) 
      motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were analyzed offline to generate map 
      characteristics of area, volume, center of gravity (COG), and hotspot magnitude. 
      Subsets of each outcome corresponding to 75%, 50%, and 25% of each map were 
      determined. Reliability measures including intraclass correlation coefficient 
      (ICC), minimal detectable change (MDC), and standard error of measure (SEM) were 
      calculated. Map volume, COG, and hotspot magnitude were the most reliable 
      measures (good-to-excellent) over both short- and long-term sessions. Map area 
      reliability was poor-to-moderate for short- and long-term sessions. Smaller map 
      percentile subsets showed decreased variability but only minimal improvements in 
      reliability. MDC for most outcomes was >50%. Procedures were well tolerated with 
      no serious adverse events. Robotic TMS motor mapping is relatively reliable over 
      time, but careful consideration of specific outcomes is required for this method 
      to interrogate plasticity in the human motor system.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Robotic 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive and safe tool that 
      produces cortical motor maps-individualized representations of the primary motor 
      cortex (M1) topography-that may reflect developmental and interventional 
      plasticity. This study is the first to evaluate short- and long-term relative and 
      absolute reliability of TMS mapping outcomes at various M1 excitability levels 
      using novel robotic neuronavigated TMS.

AB  - There has been an increasing demand for robotic coil positioning during 
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment. Accurate coil 
      positioning is crucial because rTMS generally targets specific brain regions for 
      both research and clinical application with other reasons such as safety, 
      consistency and reliability and individual variablity. Some previous studies have 
      employed industrial robots or co-robots and showed they can more precisely 
      stimulate the target cortical regions than traditional manual methods. In this 
      study, we not only developed a custom-TMS robot for better TMS coil placement but 
      also analyzed the therapeutic effects on depression. Treatment effects were 
      evaluated by measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using single-photon 
      emission computed tomography and depression severity before and after rTMS for 
      the two positioning methods. The rTMS preparation time with our robotic coil 
      placement was reduced by 53% compared with that of the manual method. The 
      position and orientation errors were also significantly reduced from 11.17 mm and 
      4.06° to 0.94 mm and 0.11°, respectively, confirming the superiority of robotic 
      positioning. The results from clinical and neuroimaging assessments indicated 
      comparable improvements in depression severity and rCBF in the left dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex between the robotic and manual rTMS groups. A questionnaire was 
      used to determine the patients' feelings about the robotic system, including the 
      safety and preparation time. A high safety score indicated good acceptability of 
      robotic rTMS at the clinical site.

TI  - Cortico-cortical stimulation and robot-assisted therapy (CCS and RAT) for upper 
      limb recovery after stroke: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since birth, during the exploration of the environment to interact 
      with objects, we exploit both the motor and sensory components of the upper limb 
      (UL). This ability to integrate sensory and motor information is often 
      compromised following a stroke. However, to date, rehabilitation protocols are 
      focused primarily on recovery of motor function through physical therapies. 
      Therefore, we have planned a clinical trial to investigate the effect on 
      functionality of UL after a sensorimotor transcranial stimulation (real vs sham) 
      in add-on to robot-assisted therapy in the stroke population. METHODS: A 
      randomised double-blind controlled trial design involving 32 patients with a 
      single chronic stroke (onset > 180 days) was planned. Each patient will undergo 
      15 consecutive sessions (5 days for 3 weeks) of paired associative stimulation 
      (PAS) coupled with UL robot-assisted therapy. PAS stimulation will be 
      administered using a bifocal transcranial magnetic stimulator (TMS) on the 
      posterior-parietal cortex and the primary motor area (real or sham) of the 
      lesioned hemisphere. Clinical, kinematics and neurophysiological changes will be 
      evaluated at the end of protocol and at 1-month follow-up and compared with 
      baseline. The Fugl-Meyer assessment scale will be the primary outcome. Secondly, 
      kinematic variables will be recorded during the box-and-block test and reaching 
      tasks using video analysis and inertial sensors. Single pulse TMS and 
      electroencephalography will be used to investigate the changes in local cortical 
      reactivity and in the interconnected areas. DISCUSSION: The presented trial shall 
      evaluate with a multimodal approach the effects of sensorimotor network 
      stimulation applied before a robot-assisted therapy training on functional 
      recovery of the upper extremity after stroke. The combination of neuromodulation 
      and robot-assisted therapy can promote an increase of cortical plasticity of 
      sensorimotor areas followed by a clinical benefit in the motor function of the 
      upper limb. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05478434. Registered on 28

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-invasive brain stimulation is being increasingly used to 
      interrogate neurophysiology and modulate brain function. Despite the high 
      scientific and therapeutic potential of non-invasive brain stimulation, 
      experience in the developing brain has been limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine the 
      safety and tolerability of non-invasive neurostimulation in children across 
      diverse modalities of stimulation and pediatric populations. METHODS: A 
      non-invasive brain stimulation program was established in 2008 at our pediatric, 
      academic institution. Multi-disciplinary neurophysiological studies included 
      single- and paired-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) methods. Motor 
      mapping employed robotic TMS. Interventional trials included repetitive TMS 
      (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Standardized safety 
      and tolerability measures were completed prospectively by all participants. 
      RESULTS: Over 10 years, 384 children underwent brain stimulation (median 13 
      years, range 0.8-18.0). Populations included typical development (n = 118), 
      perinatal stroke/cerebral palsy (n = 101), mild traumatic brain injury (n = 121) 
      neuropsychiatric disorders (n = 37), and other (n = 7). No serious adverse events 
      occurred. Drop-outs were rare (<1%). No seizures were reported despite >100 
      participants having brain injuries and/or epilepsy. Tolerability between single 
      and paired-pulse TMS (542340 stimulations) and rTMS (3.0 million stimulations) 
      was comparable and favourable. TMS-related headache was more common in perinatal 
      stroke (40%) than healthy participants (13%) but was mild and self-limiting. 
      Tolerability improved over time with side-effect frequency decreasing by >50%. 
      Robotic TMS motor mapping was well-tolerated though neck pain was more common 
      than with manual TMS (33% vs 3%). Across 612 tDCS sessions including 92 children, 
      tolerability was favourable with mild itching/tingling reported in 37%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Standard non-invasive brain stimulation paradigms are safe and 
      well-tolerated in children and should be considered minimal risk. Advancement of 
      applications in the developing brain are warranted. A new and improved pediatric 
      NIBS safety and tolerability form is included.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) motor mapping is a safe, non-invasive 
      method that can be used to study corticomotor organization. Motor maps are 
      typically acquired at rest, and comparisons to maps obtained during muscle 
      activation have been both limited and contradictory. Understanding the 
      relationship between functional activation of the corticomotor system as recorded 
      by motor mapping is crucial for their use clinically and in research. The present 
      study utilized robotic TMS paired with personalized neuro-navigation to examine 
      the relationship between resting and active motor map measures and their 
      relationship with motor performance. Twenty healthy right-handed participants 
      underwent resting and active robotic TMS motor mapping of the first dorsal 
      interosseous to 10% maximum voluntary contraction. Motor map parameters including 
      map area, volume, and measures of map centrality were compared between techniques 
      using paired sample tests of difference and Bland-Altman plots and analysis. Map 
      area, volume, and hotspot magnitude were larger in the active motor maps, while 
      map center of gravity and hotspot locations remained consistent between both 
      maps. No associations were observed between motor maps and motor performance as 
      measured by the Purdue Pegboard Test. Our findings support previous suggestions 
      that maps scale with muscle contraction. Differences in mapping outcomes suggest 
      rest and active motor maps may reflect functionally different corticomotor 
      representations. Advanced analysis methods may better characterize the underlying 
      neurophysiology of both types of motor mapping.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Novel Calibration Methodology and Control 
      Approach for Robot-Aided Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This article presents the development and validation of a new robotic 
      system for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), characterized by a new 
      control approach, and an ad-hoc calibration methodology, specifically devised for 
      the TMS application. METHODS: The robotic TMS platform is composed of a 7 dof 
      manipulator, controlled by an impedance control, and a camera-based 
      neuronavigation system. The proposed calibration method was optimized on the 
      workspace useful for the specific TMS application (spherical shell around the 
      subject's head), and tested on three different hand-eye and robot-world 
      calibration algorithms. The platform functionality was tested on six healthy 
      subjects during a real TMS procedure, over the left primary motor cortex. 
      RESULTS: employing our method significantly decreases ( ) the calibration error 
      by 34% for the position and 19% for the orientation. The robotic TMS platform 
      achieved greater orientation accuracy than the expert operators, significantly 
      reducing orientation errors by 46% ( ). No significant differences were found in 
      the position errors and in the amplitude of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) 
      between the robot-aided TMS and the expert operators. CONCLUSION: The proposed 
      calibration represents a valid method to significantly reduce the calibration 
      errors in robot-aided TMS applications. Results showed the efficacy of the 
      proposed platform (including the control algorithm) in administering a real TMS 
      procedure, achieving better coil positioning than expert operators, and similar 
      results in terms of MEPs. SIGNIFICANCE: This article spotlights how to improve 
      the performance of a robotic TMS platform, providing a reproducible and low-cost 
      alternative to the few devices commercially available.

TI  - Prefrontal transcranial magnetic stimulation boosts response vigour during 
      reinforcement learning in healthy adults.
PG  - 680-691
LID - 10.1111/ejn.15905 [doi]
AB  - A 10-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left dorsal lateral 
      prefrontal cortex has been shown to increase dopaminergic activity in the dorsal 
      striatum, a region strongly implicated in reinforcement learning. However, the 
      behavioural influence of this effect remains largely unknown. We tested the 
      causal effects of 10-Hz stimulation on behavioural and computational 
      characteristics of reinforcement learning. A total of 40 healthy individuals were 
      randomized into active and sham (placebo) stimulation groups. Each participant 
      underwent one stimulation session (1500 pulses) in which stimulation was applied 
      over the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex using a robotic arm. Participants 
      then completed a reinforcement learning task sensitive to striatal dopamine 
      functioning. Participants' choices were modelled using a reinforcement learning 
      model (Q-learning) that calculates separate learning rates associated with 
      positive and negative reward prediction errors. Subjects receiving active 
      stimulation exhibited increased reward rate (number of correct responses per 
      second of task activity) compared with those in sham. Computationally, although 
      no group differences were observed, the active group displayed a higher learning 
      rate for correct trials (αG) compared with incorrect trials (αL). Finally, when 
      tested with novel pairs of stimuli, the active group displayed extremely fast 
      reaction times, and a trend towards a higher reward rate. This study provided 
      specific behavioural and computational accounts of altered striatal-mediated 
      behaviour, particularly response vigour, induced by a proposed increase of 
      dopamine activity by 10-Hz stimulation to the left dorsal lateral prefrontal 
      cortex. Together, these findings bolster the use of repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation to target neurocognitive disturbances attributed to the 
      dysregulation of dopaminergic-striatal circuits.

TI  - Reliability of active robotic neuro-navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      motor maps.
PG  - 355-364
LID - 10.1007/s00221-022-06523-3 [doi]
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) motor mapping is a safe, non-invasive 
      method used to study corticomotor organization and intervention-induced 
      plasticity. Reliability of resting maps is well established, but understudied for 
      active maps and unestablished for active maps obtained using robotic TMS 
      techniques. The objective of  this study was to determine the reliability of 
      robotic neuro-navigated TMS motor map measures during active muscle contraction. 
      We hypothesized that map area and volume would show excellent short- and 
      medium-term reliability. Twenty healthy adults were tested on 3 days. Active maps 
      of the first dorsal interosseous muscle were created using a 12 × 12 grid (7 mm 
      spacing). Short- (24 h) and medium-term (3-5 weeks) relative (intra-class 
      correlation coefficient) and absolute (minimal detectable change (MDC); standard 
      error of measure) reliabilities were evaluated for map area, volume, center of 
      gravity (CoG), and hotspot magnitude (peak-to-peak MEP amplitude at the hotspot), 
      along with active motor threshold (AMT) and maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). 
      This study found that AMT and MVC had good-to-excellent short- and medium-term 
      reliability. Map CoG (x and y) were the most reliable map measures across 
      sessions with excellent short- and medium-term reliability (p < 0.001). Map area, 
      hotspot magnitude, and map volume followed with better reliability medium-term 
      than short-term, with a change of 28%, 62%, and 78% needed to detect a true 
      medium-term change, respectively. Therefore, robot-guided neuro-navigated TMS 
      active mapping is relatively reliable but varies across measures. This, and MDC, 
      should be considered in interventional study designs.

TI  - Bilateral transcranial magnetic stimulation of the supplementary motor area in 
      children with Tourette syndrome.
PG  - 808-815
LID - 10.1111/dmcn.14828 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To explore the feasibility and possible effects of low-frequency repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered to the supplementary motor 
      area (SMA) on tic severity and motor system neurophysiology in children with 
      Tourette syndrome. METHOD: Ten children with Tourette syndrome (eight males, two 
      females; 9-15y) participated in this open-label, phase 1 clinical trial. 
      Treatment consisted of 1800 low-frequency (1Hz) neuronavigated robotic rTMS (100% 
      resting motor threshold) to the SMA, bilaterally for 15 sessions. The primary 
      outcome was a change in Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) total score from 
      baseline to posttreatment. Secondary outcome measures included changes in 
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolite concentrations, TMS neurophysiology 
      measures, TMS motor maps, and clinical assessments (anxiety, depression) from 
      baseline to the end of treatment. RESULTS: The YGTSS score decreased from 
      baseline after treatment (p<0.001; Cohen's d=2.9). All procedures were 
      well-tolerated. INTERPRETATION: Robot-driven, neuronavigated bilateral rTMS of 
      the SMA is feasible in children with Tourette syndrome and appears to reduce tic 
      severity. What this paper adds Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (rTMS) is feasible to use in children with Tourette syndrome. rTMS is tolerated 
      by children with Tourette syndrome. Precise targeting of the supplementary motor 
      area using functional magnetic resonance imaging is also feasible in these 
      children.

TI  - Combining Robot-Assisted Gait Training and Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation in 
      Chronic Stroke Patients: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 795788
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2022.795788 [doi]
LID - 795788
AB  - Gait impairment is one of the most common disorders of patients with chronic 
      stroke, which hugely affects the ability to carry out the activities of daily 
      living and the quality of life. Recently, traditional rehabilitation techniques 
      have been associated with non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, which 
      enhance brain plasticity, with the aim of promoting recovery in patients with 
      chronic stroke. NIBS effectiveness in improving gait parameters in patients with 
      chronic stroke has been in several studies evaluated. Robotic devices are 
      emerging as promising tools for the treatment of stroke-related disabilities by 
      performing repetitive, intensive, and task-specific treatments and have been 
      proved to be effective for the enhancement of motor recovery in patients with 
      chronic stroke. To date, several studies have examined the combination of NIBS 
      with robotic-assisted gait training, but the effectiveness of this approach is 
      not yet well established. The main purpose of this systematic review is to 
      clarify whether the combination of NIBS and robot-assisted gait training may 
      improve walking function in patients with chronic stroke. Our systematic review 
      was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews 
      and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies eligible for review were 
      identified through PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and PEDro from inception to 
      March 15, 2021, and the outcomes considered were gait assessments. Seven studies 
      were included in the qualitative analysis of this systematic review, with a total 
      population of 186 patients with chronic stroke. All studies specified technical 
      characteristics of robotic devices and NIBS used, with high heterogeneity of 
      protocols. Methodological studies have shown a significantly greater improvement 
      in walking capacity recorded with 6MWT. Finally, research studies have 
      highlighted a positive effect on walking recovery by combination of 
      robot-assisted gait training with non-invasive brain stimulation. Furthermore, 
      future studies should identify the best characteristics of the combined 
      therapeutic protocols. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: CRD42021244869.

      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Enhanced Motor Learning on Robotic 
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Motor Maps in Children.

AB  - Introduction: Conventional transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and 
      high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) may improve motor learning in children. Mechanisms 
      are not understood. Neuronavigated robotic transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (TMS) can produce individualised maps of primary motor cortex (M1) topography. We 
      aimed to determine the effects of tDCS- and HD-tDCS-enhanced motor learning on 
      motor maps. Methods: Typically developing children aged 12-18 years were 
      randomised to right M1 anodal tDCS, HD-tDCS, or Sham during training of their 
      left-hand on the Purdue Pegboard Task (PPT) over 5 days. Bilateral motor mapping 
      was performed at baseline (pre), day 5 (post), and 6-weeks retention time (RT). 
      Primary muscle was the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) with secondary muscles of 
      abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and adductor digiti minimi (ADM). Primary mapping 
      outcomes were volume (mm(2)/mV) and area (mm(2)). Secondary outcomes were centre 
      of gravity (COG, mm) and hotspot magnitude (mV). Linear mixed-effects modelling 
      was employed to investigate effects of time and stimulation type (tDCS, HD-tDCS, 
      Sham) on motor map characteristics. Results: Twenty-four right-handed 
      participants (median age 15.5 years, 52% female) completed the study with no 
      serious adverse events or dropouts. Quality maps could not be obtained in two 
      participants. No effect of time or group were observed on map area or volume. 
      LFDI COG (mm) differed in the medial-lateral plane (x-axis) between tDCS and Sham 
      (p = 0.038) from pre-to-post mapping sessions. Shifts in map COG were also 
      observed for secondary left-hand muscles. Map metrics did not correlate with 
      behavioural changes. Conclusion: Robotic TMS mapping can safely assess motor 
      cortex neurophysiology in children undergoing motor learning and neuromodulation 
      interventions. Large effects on map area and volume were not observed while 
      changes in COG may occur. Larger controlled studies are required to understand 
      the role of motor maps in interventional neuroplasticity in children.

AB  - The modular organization of the cortex refers to subsets of highly interconnected 
      nodes, sharing specific cytoarchitectural and dynamical properties. These 
      properties condition the level of excitability of local pools of neurons. In this 
      study, we described TMS evoked potentials (TEP) input-output properties to 
      provide new insights into regional cortical excitability. We combined robotized 
      TMS with EEG to disentangle region-specific TEP from threshold to saturation and 
      describe their oscillatory contents. Twenty-two young healthy participants 
      received robotized TMS pulses over the right primary motor cortex (M1), the right 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the right superior occipital lobe 
      (SOL) at five stimulation intensities (40, 60, 80, 100, and 120% resting motor 
      threshold) and one short-interval intracortical inhibition condition during EEG 
      recordings. Ten additional subjects underwent the same experiment with a 
      realistic sham TMS procedure. The results revealed interregional differences in 
      the TEPs input-output functions as well as in the responses to paired-pulse 
      conditioning protocols, when considering early local components (<80 ms). Each 
      intensity in the three regions was associated with complex patterns of 
      oscillatory activities. The quality of the regression of TEPs over stimulation 
      intensity was used to derive a new readout for cortical excitability and 
      dynamical properties, revealing lower excitability in the DLPFC, followed by SOL 
      and M1. The realistic sham experiment confirmed that these early local components 
      were not contaminated by multisensory stimulations. This study provides an 
      entirely new analytic framework to characterize input-output relations throughout 
      the cortex, paving the way to a more accurate definition of local cortical 
      excitability.

      limb motor function in stroke patients. (2) Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, and CINAHL 
      were used for the literature research. Articles were searched using the following 
      terms: "Stroke OR CVA OR cerebrovascular accident" AND "upper limb OR upper 
      extremity" AND "NIBS OR Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation" OR "rTMS" OR "repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation" OR "tDCS" OR "transcranial direct current 
      stimulation" AND "RCT" OR randomized control trial." In total, 12 studies were 
      included in the final analysis. (3) Results: Analysis using the Physiotherapy 
      Evidence Database scale for qualitative evaluation of the literature rated eight 
      articles as "excellent" and four as "good." Combined rehabilitation interventions 
      included robotic therapy, motor imagery using brain-computer interaction, sensory 
      control, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, task-oriented approach, 
      task-oriented mirror therapy, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and behavior 
      observation therapy. (4) Conclusions: Although it is difficult to estimate the 
      recovery of upper limb motor function in stroke patients treated with noninvasive 
      brain stimulation alone, a combination of a task-oriented approach, occupational 
      therapy, action observation, wrist robot-assisted rehabilitation, and physical 
      therapy can be effective.

AB  - Previous research has suggested that the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) is 
      involved with visual decision making, and specifically with the accumulation of 
      information leading to a decision. In humans, this research has been primarily 
      based on imaging and electroencephalography (EEG), and as such only 
      correlational. One line of such research has led to a model of three spatially 
      distributed brain networks that activate in temporal sequence to enable visual 
      decision-making. The model predicted that disturbing neural processing in the LOC 
      at a specific latency would slow object decision-making, increasing reaction time 
      (RT) in a difficult discrimination task. We utilized transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (TMS) to test this prediction, perturbing LOC beginning at 400 ms 
      post-stimulus onset, a time in the model corresponding to LOC activation at a 
      particular difficulty level, with the expectation of increased RT. Thirteen 
      healthy adults participated in two TMS sessions in which left and right LOC were 
      stimulated separately utilizing neuronavigation and robotic coil guidance. 
      Participants performed a two-alternative forced-choice task selecting whether a 
      car or face was present on each trial amidst visual noise pre-tested to 
      approximate a 75% accuracy level. In an effort to disrupt processing, pairs of 
      TMS pulses separated by 50 ms were presented at one of five stimulus onset 
      asynchronies (SOAs): -200, 200, 400, 450, or 500 ms. Behavioral performance 
      differed systematically across SOAs for RT and accuracy measures. As predicted, 
      TMS at 400 ms resulted in a significant slowing of RT. TMS delivered at -200 ms 
      resulted in faster RT, indicating early stimulation may result in priming and 
      performance enhancement. Use of TMS thus causally demonstrated the involvement of 
      LOC in this task, and more broadly with perceptual decision-making; additionally, 
      it demonstrated the role of TMS in testing well-developed neural models of 
      perceptual processing.

TI  - Motor adaptation and internal model formation in a robot-mediated forcefield.
PG  - 73-87
LID - 10.1093/psyrad/kkab007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Motor adaptation relies on error-based learning for accurate 
      movements in changing environments. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms 
      driving individual differences in performance are unclear. Transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (TMS)-evoked potential can provide a direct measure of cortical 
      excitability. OBJECTIVE: To investigate cortical excitability as a predictor of 
      motor learning and motor adaptation in a robot-mediated forcefield. METHODS: A 
      group of 15 right-handed healthy participants (mean age 23 years) performed a 
      robot-mediated forcefield perturbation task. There were two conditions: 
      unperturbed non-adaptation and perturbed adaptation. TMS was applied in the 
      resting state at baseline and following motor adaptation over the contralateral 
      primary motor cortex (left M1). Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was 
      continuously recorded, and cortical excitability was measured by TMS-evoked 
      potential (TEP). Motor learning was quantified by the motor learning index. 
      RESULTS: Larger error-related negativity (ERN) in fronto-central regions was 
      associated with improved motor performance as measured by a reduction in 
      trajectory errors. Baseline TEP N100 peak amplitude predicted motor learning 
      (P = 0.005), which was significantly attenuated relative to baseline (P = 0.0018) 
      following motor adaptation. CONCLUSIONS: ERN reflected the formation of a 
      predictive internal model adapted to the forcefield perturbation. Attenuation in 
      TEP N100 amplitude reflected an increase in cortical excitability with motor 
      adaptation reflecting neuroplastic changes in the sensorimotor cortex. TEP N100 
      is a potential biomarker for predicting the outcome in robot-mediated therapy and 
      a mechanism to investigate psychomotor abnormalities in depression.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate neurophysiological alterations within the typical 
      symptomatic period after concussion (1-month) and throughout recovery (6-months) 
      in adolescents; and (2) to examine relationships between neurophysiological and 
      upper limb kinematic outcomes.METHODS: 18 adolescents with concussion were 
      compared to 17 healthy controls. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used 
      to assess neurophysiological differences between groups including: short- and 
      long-interval intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation, short- and 
      long-latency afferent inhibition, afferent facilitation, and transcallosal 
      inhibition (TCI). Behavioral measures of upper limb kinematics were assessed with 
      a robotic device.RESULTS: Mixed model analysis of neurophysiological data 
      identified two key findings. First, participants with concussion demonstrated 
      delayed onset of interhemispheric inhibition, as indexed by TCI, compared to 
      healthy controls. Second, our exploratory analysis indicated that the magnitude 
      of TCI onset delay in adolescents with concussion was related to upper limb 
      kinematics.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that concussion in adolescence 
      alters interhemispheric communication. We note relationships between 
      neurophysiological and kinematic data, suggesting an affinity for individuals 
      with less concussion-related physiological change to improve their motor behavior 
      over time. These data serve as an important step in future development of 
      assessments (neurobiological and clinical) and interventions for concussion.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) mapping has become a 
      critical tool for exploratory studies of the human corticomotor (M1) 
      organization. Here, we propose to gather existing cutting-edge TMS-EMG and 
      TMS-EEG approaches into a combined multi-dimensional TMS mapping that considers 
      local and whole-brain excitability changes as well as state and time-specific 
      changes in cortical activity. We applied this multi-dimensional TMS mapping 
      approach to patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with Deep brain stimulation 
      (DBS) of the sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) ON and OFF. Our goal was to identifying 
      one or several TMS mapping-derived markers that could provide unprecedent new 
      insights onto the mechanisms of DBS in movement disorders. METHODS: Six PD 
      patients (1 female, mean age: 62.5 yo [59-65]) implanted with DBS-STN for 1 year, 
      underwent a robotized sulcus-shaped TMS motor mapping to measure changes in 
      muscle-specific corticomotor representations and a movement initiation task to 
      probe state-dependent modulations of corticospinal excitability in the ON (using 
      clinically relevant DBS parameters) and OFF DBS states. Cortical excitability and 
      evoked dynamics of three cortical areas involved in the neural control of 
      voluntary movements (M1, pre-supplementary motor area - preSMA and inferior 
      frontal gyrus - IFG) were then mapped using TMS-EEG coupling in the ON and OFF 
      state. Lastly, we investigated the timing and nature of the STN-to-M1 inputs 
      using a paired pulse DBS-TMS-EEG protocol. RESULTS: In our sample of patients, 
      DBS appeared to induce fast within-area somatotopic re-arrangements of motor 
      finger representations in M1, as revealed by mediolateral shifts of corticomuscle 
      representations. STN-DBS improved reaction times while up-regulating 
      corticospinal excitability, especially during endogenous motor preparation. 
      Evoked dynamics revealed marked increases in inhibitory circuits in the IFG and 
      M1 with DBS ON. Finally, inhibitory conditioning effects of STN single pulses on 
      corticomotor activity were found at timings relevant for the activation of 
      inhibitory GABAergic receptors (4 and 20 ms). CONCLUSION: Taken together, these 
      results suggest a predominant role of some markers in explaining beneficial DBS 
      effects, such as a context-dependent modulation of corticospinal excitability and 
      the recruitment of distinct inhibitory circuits, involving long-range projections 
      from higher level motor centers and local GABAergic neuronal populations. These 
      combined measures might help to identify discriminative features of DBS 
      mechanisms towards deep clinical phenotyping of DBS effects in Parkinson's 
      Disease and in other pathological conditions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Single and Paired Pulse TMS-EEG Responses.
PG  - 425-437
LID - 10.1007/s10548-020-00773-6 [doi]
AB  - For physiological brain function a particular balance between excitation and 
      inhibition is essential. Paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can 
      estimate cortical excitability and the relative contribution of inhibitory and 
      excitatory networks. Combining TMS with electroencephalography (EEG) enables 
      additional assessment of the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal responses in the 
      stimulated brain. This study aims to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics and 
      stability of single and paired pulse TMS-EEG responses, and assess long 
      intracortical inhibition (LICI) at the cortical level. Twenty-five healthy 
      subjects were studied twice, approximately one week apart. Manual coil 
      positioning was applied in sixteen subjects and robot-guided positioning in nine. 
      Both motor cortices were stimulated with 50 single pulses and 50 paired pulses at 
      each of the five interstimulus intervals (ISIs): 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 ms. 
      To assess stability and LICI, the intraclass correlation coefficient and 
      cluster-based permutation analysis were used. We found great resemblance in the 
      topographical distribution of the characteristic TMS-EEG components for single 
      and paired pulse TMS. Stimulation of the dominant and non-dominant hemisphere 
      resulted in a mirrored spatiotemporal dynamics. No significant effect on the 
      TMS-EEG responses was found for either stimulated hemisphere, time or coil 
      positioning method, indicating the stability of both single and paired pulse 
      TMS-EEG responses. For all ISIs, LICI was characterized by significant 
      suppression of the late N100 and P180 components in the central areas, without 
      affecting the early P30, N45 and P60 components. These observations in healthy 
      subjects can serve as reference values for future neuropsychiatric and 
      pharmacological studies.

TI  - Effectiveness of soft robotic glove versus repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation in post-stroke patients with severe upper limb dysfunction: A 
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 887205
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2022.887205 [doi]
LID - 887205
AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the difference in rehabilitation effect between soft robot 
      gloves and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in patients with 
      severe upper limb motor dysfunction after a stroke. METHODS: A total of 69 
      post-stroke patients with severe upper limb dysfunction were randomly assigned to 
      a repetitive transcranial magnetic group, a soft robotic glove group, and a 
      conventional treatment group. The primary outcomes were the Fugl-Meyer Upper 
      Extremity Assessment (FMA-UE) and the Modified Barthel Index (MBI). The secondary 
      endpoints were the amplitude surface electromyogram of the extensor wrist muscle 
      (sEMG) and the cerebral hemispheric resting motor threshold (RMT). RESULTS: The 
      change of FMA-UE score in the soft robotic glove group was significantly better 
      than that in the conventional treatment group (median difference: 2 points; 95% 
      confidence interval [1, 3]; P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference 
      compared with the repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation group (median 
      difference: 0 points; 95% confidence interval [-1, 2]; P [0.547] > 0.05). There 
      was no significant difference in the change of MBI score between the soft robotic 
      glove group and the conventional treatment and repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      treatment groups [F = 2.458, P [0.093] > 0.05]. There was no significant 
      difference in the change of sEMG score between the soft robotic glove group and 
      the conventional treatment and repetitive transcranial magnetic treatment groups 
      [H = 0.042, P [0.980] > 0.05]. Additionally, the change of RMT score in the soft 
      robotic glove group was significantly inferior to that in the repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic treatment group [difference: -1.09; 95% confidence interval 
      [-2.048, 0.048]; P < 0.05], but there was no significant difference compared with 
      the conventional treatment group [difference: 0.31 points; 95% confidence 
      interval [-0.879, 0.358]; P [0.495] > 0.05]. CONCLUSION: For patients with severe 
      dyskinesia after a stroke, soft robotic gloves are as effective as repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation and may be a good choice for home 
      rehabilitation. In addition, conventional treatment combined with repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or a soft robotic glove produced better 
      rehabilitation outcomes than conventional treatment alone.

TI  - Gait Recovery in Spinal Cord Injury: A Systematic Review with Metanalysis 
      Involving New Rehabilitative Technologies.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci13050703 [doi]
LID - 703
AB  - Gait recovery is a fundamental goal in patients with spinal cord injury to attain 
      greater autonomy and quality of life. Robotics is becoming a valid tool in 
      improving motor, balance, and gait function in this patient population. Moreover, 
      other innovative approaches are leading to promising results. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate new rehabilitative methods for gait recovery in people 
      who have suffered spinal cord injuries. A systematic review of the last 10 years 
      of the literature was performed in three databases (PubMed, PEDro, andCochrane). 
      We followed this PICO of the review: P: adults with non-progressive spinal cord 
      injury; I: new rehabilitative methods; C: new methods vs. conventional methods; 
      and O: improvement of gait parameters. When feasible, a comparison through ES 
      forest plots was performed. A total of 18 RCTs of the 599 results obtained were 
      included. The studies investigated robotic rehabilitation (n = 10), intermittent 
      hypoxia (N = 3) and external stimulation (N = 5). Six studies of the first group 
      (robotic rehabilitation) were compared using a forest plot for 10MWT, LEMS, 
      WISCI-II, and SCIM-3. The other clinical trials were analyzed through a narrative 
      review of the results. We found weak evidence for the claim that robotic devices 
      lead to better outcomes in gait independence compared to conventional 
      rehabilitation methods. External stimulation and intermittent hypoxia seem to 
      improve gait parameters associated with other rehabilitation methods. Research 
      investigating the role of innovative technologies in improving gait and balance 
      is needed since walking ability is a fundamental issue in patients with SCI.

TI  - Multimodal treatment for spinal cord injury: a sword of neuroregeneration upon 
      neuromodulation.
PG  - 1437-1450
LID - 10.4103/1673-5374.274332 [doi]
AB  - Spinal cord injury is linked to the interruption of neural pathways, which 
      results in irreversible neural dysfunction. Neural repair and neuroregeneration 
      are critical goals and issues for rehabilitation in spinal cord injury, which 
      require neural stem cell repair and multimodal neuromodulation techniques 
      involving personalized rehabilitation strategies. Besides the involvement of 
      endogenous stem cells in neurogenesis and neural repair, exogenous neural stem 
      cell transplantation is an emerging effective method for repairing and replacing 
      damaged tissues in central nervous system diseases. However, to ensure that 
      endogenous or exogenous neural stem cells truly participate in neural repair 
      following spinal cord injury, appropriate interventional measures (e.g., 
      neuromodulation) should be adopted. Neuromodulation techniques, such as 
      noninvasive magnetic stimulation and electrical stimulation, have been safely 
      applied in many neuropsychiatric diseases. There is increasing evidence to 
      suggest that neuromagnetic/electrical modulation promotes neuroregeneration and 
      neural repair by affecting signaling in the nervous system; namely, by exciting, 
      inhibiting, or regulating neuronal and neural network activities to improve motor 
      function and motor learning following spinal cord injury. Several studies have 
      indicated that fine motor skill rehabilitation training makes use of residual 
      nerve fibers for collateral growth, encourages the formation of new synaptic 
      connections to promote neural plasticity, and improves motor function recovery in 
      patients with spinal cord injury. With the development of biomaterial technology 
      and biomechanical engineering, several emerging treatments have been developed, 
      such as robots, brain-computer interfaces, and nanomaterials. These treatments 
      have the potential to help millions of patients suffering from motor dysfunction 
      caused by spinal cord injury. However, large-scale clinical trials need to be 
      conducted to validate their efficacy. This review evaluated the efficacy of 
      neural stem cells and magnetic or electrical stimulation combined with 
      rehabilitation training and intelligent therapies for spinal cord injury 
      according to existing evidence, to build up a multimodal treatment strategy of 
      spinal cord injury to enhance nerve repair and regeneration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of robot-assisted gait 
      training (RAGT) therapy combined with non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) on 
      lower limb function in patients with stroke and spinal cord injury (SCI). DATA 
      SOURCES: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, 
      and Web of Science were searched. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) published as of 3 March 2021. RCTs evaluating RAGT combined with NIBS, 
      such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), for lower limb function (e.g., 
      Fugl-Meyer assessment for patients with stroke) and activities (i.e., gait 
      velocity) in patients with stroke and SCI were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Two 
      reviewers independently screened the records, extracted the data, and assessed 
      the risk of bias. DATA SYNTHESIS: A meta-analysis of five studies (104 
      participants) and risk of bias were conducted. Pooled estimates demonstrated that 
      RAGT combined with NIBS significantly improved lower limb function [standardized 
      mean difference (SMD) = 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.06-0.99] but not 
      lower limb activities (SMD = -0.13; 95% CI = -0.63-0.38). Subgroup analyses also 
      failed to find a greater improvement in lower limb function of RAGT with tDCS 
      compared to sham stimulation. No significant differences between participant 
      characteristics or types of NIBS were observed. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis 
      demonstrated that RAGT therapy in combination with NIBS was effective in patients 
      with stroke and SCI. However, a greater improvement in lower limb function and 
      activities were not observed using RAGT with tDCS compared to sham stimulation.

AB  - Neurorecovery from locomotor training is well established in human spinal cord 
      injury (SCI). However, neurorecovery resulting from combined interventions has 
      not been widely studied. In this randomized clinical trial, we established the 
      tibialis anterior (TA) flexion reflex modulation pattern when transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex was paired with 
      transcutaneous spinal cord (transspinal) stimulation over the thoracolumbar 
      region during assisted step training. Single pulses of TMS were delivered either 
      before (TMS-transspinal) or after (transspinal-TMS) transspinal stimulation 
      during the stance phase of the less impaired leg. Eight individuals with chronic 
      incomplete or complete SCI received at least 20 sessions of paired stimulation 
      during assisted step training. Each session consisted of 240 paired stimuli 
      delivered over 10-min blocks for 1 h during robotic-assisted step training with 
      the Lokomat6 Pro(®). Body weight support, leg guidance force and treadmill speed 
      were adjusted based on each participant's ability to step without knee buckling 
      or toe dragging. Both the early and late TA flexion reflex remained unaltered 
      after TMS-transspinal and locomotor training. In contrast, the early and late TA 
      flexion reflexes were significantly depressed during stepping after 
      transspinal-TMS and locomotor training. Reflex changes occurred at similar slopes 
      and intercepts before and after training. Our findings support that targeted 
      brain and spinal cord stimulation coupled with locomotor training reorganizes the 
      function of flexion reflex pathways, which are a part of locomotor networks, in 
      humans with varying levels of sensorimotor function after SCI.Trial registration

AB  - Combined interventions for neuromodulation leading to neurorecovery have gained 
      great attention by researchers to resemble clinical rehabilitation approaches. In 
      this randomized clinical trial, we established changes in the net output of 
      motoneurons innervating multiple leg muscles during stepping when transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex was paired with 
      transcutaneous spinal (transspinal) stimulation over the thoracolumbar region 
      during locomotor training. TMS was delivered before (TMS-transspinal) or after 
      (transspinal-TMS) transspinal stimulation during the stance phase of the less 
      impaired leg. Ten individuals with chronic incomplete or complete SCI received at 
      least 20 sessions of training. Each session consisted of 240 paired stimuli 
      delivered over 10-min blocks for 1 h during robotic assisted step training on a 
      motorized treadmill. Body weight support, leg guidance force and treadmill speed 
      were adjusted based on each subject's ability to step without knee buckling or 
      toe dragging. Most transspinal evoked potentials (TEPs) recorded before and after 
      each intervention from ankle and knee muscles during assisted stepping were 
      modulated in a phase-dependent pattern. Transspinal-TMS and locomotor training 
      affected motor neuron output of knee and ankle muscles with ankle TEPs to be 
      modulated in a phase-dependent manner. TMS-transspinal and locomotor training 
      increased motor neuron output for knee but not for ankle muscles. Our results 
      support that targeted brain and spinal cord stimulation alters responsiveness of 
      neurons over multiple spinal segments in people with chronic SCI. Noninvasive 
      stimulation of the brain and spinal cord along with locomotor training is a novel 
      neuromodulation method that can become a promising modality for rehabilitation in 
      humans after SCI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While the facilitatory and inhibitory effects of intermittent theta 
      burst stimulation (iTBS) and continuous TBS (cTBS) protocols have been well 
      documented on motor physiology, the action of TBS protocols on prefrontal 
      functioning remain unclear. Here we asked whether iTBS or cTBS can differentially 
      modulate reward-related signaling in the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC). 
      METHODS: Across 2 experiments, we used a robot-assisted transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation system, combined with electroencephalogram recordings, to investigate 
      the aftereffects of prefrontal iTBS and cTBS on the reward positivity, an 
      electrophysiological signal believed to index sensitivity of the aMCC to rewards. 
      Twenty adults (age, 18-28 years) participated in experiment 1 in which we used a 
      scalp landmark for TBS targeting, and 14 adults (age, 18-28 years) participated 
      in experiment 2, in which we aimed to increase TBS effectiveness by utilizing 
      cortical thickness maps to select individualized dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex 
      targets. RESULTS: We demonstrated that prefrontal iTBS suppressed reward-related 
      signaling in the aMCC (reduction in reward positivity) and caused a decrease in 
      postfeedback switch choices. cTBS displayed no effect. We replicated and 
      strengthened this effect on the reward positivity by targeting dorsal lateral 
      prefrontal cortex regions displaying maximal cortical thickness. CONCLUSIONS: 
      While these results are inconsistent with reported TBS effects on motor cortex, 
      the present findings offer a novel transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting 
      approach and normative insights into the magnitude and time course of TBS-induced 
      changes in aMCC excitability. By modulating how the aMCC links value to 
      goal-directed behavior, this research opens an exciting new era of investigative 
      possibilities in the understanding of aMCC function and treatment of aMCC 
      dysfunction.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which arose in late 2019, caused 
      extensive destruction, impacting a substantial proportion of the worldwide 
      population and leading to millions of deaths. Although COVID-19 is mainly linked 
      to respiratory and pulmonary complications, it has the potential to affect 
      neurologic structures as well. Neurological involvement may manifest as minimal 
      and reversible; however, a notable proportion of cases have exhibited pronounced 
      neurological consequences, such as strokes. Endothelial inflammation, 
      hypercoagulation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system alterations, and 
      cardiogenic embolism are the pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke under 
      COVID-19 circumstances. Physical activity and exercise have improved several 
      aspects of post-stroke recovery, including cardiovascular health, walking 
      capacity, and upper limb strength. They are commonly used to assist stroke 
      survivors in overcoming their motor restrictions. Furthermore, stroke 
      rehabilitation can incorporate a range of specific techniques, including 
      body-weight-supported treadmill applications, constraint-induced movement 
      therapy, robotic rehabilitation interventions, transcranial direct current 
      stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and prism adaptation training. 
      Under pandemic conditions, there were several barriers to neurological 
      rehabilitation. The most significant of these were individual's fear of 
      infection, which caused them to postpone their rehabilitation applications and 
      rehabilitation areas being converted into COVID-19 units. The primary emphasis 
      had turned to COVID-19 treatment. Several valuable data and views were gained in 
      reorganizing rehabilitation during the pandemic, contributing to establishing 
      future views in this regard.

TI  - Adaptation of the Corticomuscular and Biomechanical Systems of Pianists.

AB  - Independent control of movements between the fingers plays a role in hand 
      dexterity characterizing skilled individuals. However, it remains unknown whether 
      and in what manner neuromuscular and biomechanical constraints on the movement 
      independence of the fingers depend on motor expertise. Here, we compared motor 
      dexterity, corticospinal excitability of multiple muscles, muscular activation, 
      and anatomical features of the fingers between the pianists and nonpianists. When 
      the ring finger was passively moved by a robot, passive motions produced at the 
      adjacent fingers were smaller for the pianists than the nonpianists, indicating 
      reduced biomechanical constraint of fingers in the pianists. In contrast, when 
      the ring finger moved actively, we found no group difference in passive motions 
      produced at the adjacent fingers; however, reduced inhibition of corticospinal 
      excitability of the adjacent fingers in the pianists compared with the 
      nonpianists. This suggests strengthened neuromuscular coupling between the 
      fingers of the pianists, enhancing the production of coordinated finger 
      movements. These group differences were not evident during the index and little 
      finger movements. Together, pianists show expertise-dependent biomechanical and 
      neurophysiological adaptations, specifically at the finger with innately low 
      movement independence. Such contrasting adaptations of pianists may subserve 
      dexterous control of both the individuated and coordinated finger movements.

TI  - Semi-automated motor hotspot search (SAMHS): a framework toward an optimised 
      approach for motor hotspot identification.
PG  - 1228859
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2023.1228859 [doi]
LID - 1228859
AB  - BACKGROUND: Motor hotspot identification represents the first step in the 
      determination of the motor threshold and is the basis for the specification of 
      stimulation intensity used for various Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) 
      applications. The level of experimenters' experience and the methodology of motor 
      hotspot identification differ between laboratories. The need for an optimized and 
      time-efficient technique for motor hotspot identification is therefore 
      substantial. OBJECTIVE: With the current work, we present a framework for an 
      optimized and time-efficient semi-automated motor hotspot search (SAMHS) 
      technique utilizing a neuronavigated robot-assisted TMS system (TMS-cobot). 
      Furthermore, we aim to test its practicality and accuracy by a comparison with a 
      manual motor hotspot identification method. METHOD: A total of 32 participants 
      took part in this dual-center study. At both study centers, participants 
      underwent manual hotspot search (MHS) with an experienced TMS researcher, and the 
      novel SAMHS procedure with a TMS-cobot (hereafter, called cobot hotspot search, 
      CHS) in a randomized order. Resting motor threshold (RMT), and stimulus intensity 
      to produce 1 mV (SI1mV) peak-to-peak of motor-evoked potential (MEP), as well as 
      MEPs with 120% RMT and SI1mV were recorded as outcome measures for comparison. 
      RESULTS: Compared to the MHS method, the CHS produced lower RMT, lower SI1mV and 
      a trend-wise higher peak-to-peak MEP amplitude in stimulations with SI1mV. The 
      duration of the CHS procedure was longer than that of the MHS (15.60 vs. 2.43 min 
      on average). However, accuracy of the hotspot was higher for the CHS compared to 
      the MHS. CONCLUSIONS: The SAMHS procedure introduces an optimized motor hotspot 
      determination system that is easy to use, and strikes a fairly good balance 
      between accuracy and speed. This new procedure can thus be deplored by 
      experienced as well as beginner-level TMS researchers.

AB  - Neurorehabilitation devices and technologies are crucial for enhancing stroke 
      recovery. These include noninvasive brain stimulation devices that provide 
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current 
      stimulation, which can remodulate an injured brain. Technologies such as 
      robotics, virtual reality, and telerehabilitation are suitable add-ons or 
      complements to physical therapy. However, the appropriate application of these 
      devices and technologies, which target specific deficits and stages, for stroke 
      therapy must be clarified. Accordingly, a literature review was conducted to 
      evaluate the theoretical and practical evidence on the use of neurorehabilitation 
      devices and technologies for stroke therapy. This narrative review provides a 
      practical guide for the use of neurorehabilitation devices and describes the 
      implications of use and potential integration of these devices into healthcare.

TI  - Efficient TMS-Based Motor Cortex Mapping Using Gaussian Process Active Learning.
PG  - 1679-1689
LID - 10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3105644 [doi]
AB  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) can be used to map cortical motor 
      topography by spatially sampling the sensorimotor cortex while recording Motor 
      Evoked Potentials (MEP) with surface electromyography (EMG). Traditional sampling 
      strategies are time-consuming and inefficient, as they ignore the fact that 
      responsive sites are typically sparse and highly spatially correlated. An 
      alternative approach, commonly employed when TMS mapping is used for presurgical 
      planning, is to leverage the expertise of the coil operator to use MEPs elicited 
      by previous stimuli as feedback to decide which loci to stimulate next. In this 
      paper, we propose to automatically infer optimal future stimulus loci using 
      active learning Gaussian Process-based sampling in place of user expertise. We 
      first compare the user-guided (USRG) method to the traditional grid selection 
      method and randomized sampling to verify that the USRG approach has superior 
      performance. We then compare several novel active Gaussian Process (GP) 
      strategies with the USRG approach. Experimental results using real data show 
      that, as expected, the USRG method is superior to the grid and random approach in 
      both time efficiency and MEP map accuracy. We also found that an active warped GP 
      entropy and a GP random-based strategy performed equally as well as, or even 
      better than, the USRG method. These methods were completely automatic, and 
      succeeded in efficiently sampling the regions in which the MEP response 
      variations are largely confined. This work provides the foundation for highly 
      efficient, fully automatized TMS mapping, especially when considered in the 
      context of advances in robotic coil operation.

TI  - Baseline Predictors of Response to Repetitive Task Practice in Chronic Stroke.
PG  - 426-436
LID - 10.1177/15459683221095171 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Repetitive task practice reduces mean upper extremity motor 
      impairment in populations of patients with chronic stroke, but individual 
      response is highly variable. A method to predict meaningful reduction in 
      impairment in response to training based on biomarkers and other data collected 
      prior to an intervention is needed to establish realistic rehabilitation goals 
      and to effectively allocate resources. OBJECTIVES: To identify prognostic factors 
      and better understand the biological substrate for reductions in arm impairment 
      in response to repetitive task practice among patients with chronic (≥6 months) 
      post-stroke hemiparesis. METHODS: The intervention is a form of repetitive task 
      practice using a combination of robot-assisted therapy and functional arm use in 
      real-world tasks. Baseline measures include the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Wolf Motor 
      Function Test, Action Research Arm Test, Stroke Impact Scale, questionnaires on 
      pain and expectancy, MRI, transcranial magnetic stimulation, kinematics, 
      accelerometry, and genomic testing. RESULTS: Mean increase in FM-UE was 4.6 ± 1.0 
      SE, median 2.5. Approximately one-third of participants had a clinically 
      meaningful response to the intervention, defined as an increase in FM ≥ 5. The 
      selected logistic regression model had a receiver operating curve with AUC = .988 
      (Std Error = .011, 95% Wald confidence limits: .967-1) showed little evidence of 
      overfitting. Six variables that predicted response represented impairment, 
      functional, and genomic measures. CONCLUSION: A simple weighted sum of 6 baseline 
      factors can accurately predict clinically meaningful impairment reduction after 
      outpatient intensive practice intervention in chronic stroke. Reduction of 
      impairment may be a critical first step to functional improvement. Further 
      validation and generalization of this model will increase its utility in clinical 
      decision-making.

TI  - Gait analysis patterns and rehabilitative interventions to improve gait in 
      persons with hereditary spastic paraplegia: a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a group of inheritance 
      diseases resulting in gait abnormalities, which may be detected using 
      instrumented gait analysis. The aim of this systematic review was 2-fold: to 
      identify specific gait analysis patterns and interventions improving gait in HSP 
      subjects. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, 
      REHABDATA, and PEDro databases, in accordance with reporting guidelines of PRISMA 
      statement and Cochrane's recommendation. The review protocol was recorded on the 
      PROSPERO register. Patients with pure and complicated HSP of any age were 
      included. All types of studies were included. Risk of bias, quality assessment, 
      and meta-analysis were performed. RESULTS: Forty-two studies were included: 19 
      were related to gait analysis patterns, and 24 were intervention studies. The 
      latter ones were limited to adults. HSP gait patterns were similar to cerebral 
      palsy in younger subjects and stroke in adults. Knee hyperextension, reduced 
      range of motion at knee, ankle, and hip, reduced foot lift, and increased rapid 
      trunk and arm movements were reported. Botulinum injections reduced spasticity 
      but uncovered weakness and improved gait velocity at follow-up. Weak evidence 
      supported intrathecal baclofen, active intensive physical therapy (i.e., 
      robot-assisted gait training, functional exercises, and hydrotherapy), and 
      functional electrical stimulation. Some improvements but adverse events were 
      reported after transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcutaneous spinal direct 
      current stimulation, and spinal cord stimulation implant. CONCLUSION: Knee 
      hyperextension, non-sagittal pelvic movements, and reduced ROM at the knee, 
      ankle, and hip represent the most peculiar patterns in HSP, compared to diplegic 
      cerebral palsy and stroke. Botulinum improved comfortable gait velocity after 2 
      months. Nonetheless, interventions reducing spasticity might result in 
      ineffective functional outcomes unveiling weakness. Intensive active physical 
      therapy and FES might improve gait velocity in the very short term.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Theoretical and empirical work suggest that addictive drugs 
      potentiate dopaminergic reinforcement learning signals and disrupt the reward 
      function of its neural targets, including the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) 
      and the basal ganglia. Here, we aim to use prefrontal 10-Hz TMS to enhance aMCC 
      reward activity and reward learning by the basal ganglia in problematic substance 
      users. METHODS: 22 problematic substance users were randomized into an Active and 
      SHAM (coil flipped) TMS group. We recorded the reward positivity-an 
      electrophysiological signal believed to index sensitivity of the aMCC to 
      rewards-while participants engaged in 4 blocks (100 trials per block) of a 
      reward-based choice task. A robotic arm positioned a TMS coil over a prefrontal 
      cortex target, and 50 pulses were delivered at 10-Hz before every 10 trials of 
      blocks 2-4 (1500 pulses, 400 trials). Participants then completed a 
      decision-making task that is diagnostic of striatal dopamine dysfunction. 
      RESULTS: The present study revealed three main findings. First, both groups 
      failed to elicit a reward positivity during the first two task blocks. Second, 
      applying robot-assisted TMS enhanced the amplitude of the reward positivity in 
      the Active group, but not the SHAM group, across the last two task blocks. Third, 
      the Active group performed relatively better at reward-based learning than the 
      SHAM group. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that 10-Hz TMS is successful in 
      modulating the reward function of the aMCC and basal ganglia in problematic 
      substance users, which may have utility in the treatment of reward-related neural 
      dysfunction commonly associated with substance use disorders.

AB  - The use of TMS-EEG coupling as a neuroimaging tool for the functional exploration 
      of the human brain recently gained strong interest. If this tool directly 
      inherits the fine temporal resolution from EEG, its spatial counterpart remains 
      unknown. In this study, we explored the spatial resolution of TMS-EEG coupling by 
      evaluating the minimal distance between two stimulated cortical sites that would 
      significantly evoke different response dynamics. TMS evoked responses were mapped 
      on the sensorimotor region in twenty participants. The stimulation grid was 
      composed of nine targets separated between 10 and 15 mm on average. The dynamical 
      signatures of TMS evoked activity were extracted and compared between sites using 
      both local and remote linear regression scores and spatial generalized mixed 
      models. We found a significant effect of the distance between stimulated sites on 
      their dynamical signatures, neighboring sites showing differentiable response 
      dynamics. Besides, common dynamical signatures were also found between sites up 
      to 25-30 mm from each other. This overlap in dynamical properties decreased with 
      distance and was stronger between sites within the same Brodmann area. Our 
      results suggest that the spatial resolution of TMS-EEG coupling might be at least 
      as high as 10 mm. Furthermore, our results reveal an anisotropic spatial 
      resolution that was higher across than within the same Brodmann areas, in 
      accordance with the TMS induced E-field modeling. Common cytoarchitectonic 
      leading to shared dynamical properties within the same Brodmann area could also 
      explain this anisotropy. Overall, these findings suggest that TMS-EEG benefits 
      from the spatial resolution of TMS, which makes it an accurate technique for 
      meso-scale brain mapping.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical training is able to induce changes at neurophysiological and 
      behavioral level associated with performance changes for the trained movements. 
      The current study explores the effects of an additional intense robot-assisted 
      upper extremity training on functional outcome and motor excitability in subacute 
      stroke patients. METHODS: Thirty moderately to severely affected 
      patients < 3 months after stroke received a conventional inpatient 
      rehabilitation. Based on a case-control principle 15 patients were assigned to 
      receive additional 45 min of robot-assisted therapy (Armeo(®)Spring) 5 times per 
      week (n = 15, intervention group, IG). The Fugl-Meyer Assessment for the Upper 
      Extremity (FMA-UE) was chosen as primary outcome parameter. Patients were tested 
      before and after a 3-week treatment period as well as after a follow-up period of 
      2 weeks. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation motor evoked potentials (MEPs) 
      and cortical silent periods were recorded from the deltoid muscle on both sides 
      before and after the intervention period to study effects at neurophysiological 
      level. Statistical analysis was performed with non-parametric tests. Correlation 
      analysis was done with Spearman´s rank correlation co-efficient. RESULTS: Both 
      groups showed a significant improvement in FMA-UE from pre to post (IG: + 10.6 
      points, control group (CG): + 7.3 points) and from post to follow-up (IG: + 3.9 
      points, CG: + 3.3 points) without a significant difference between them. However, 
      at neurophysiological level post-intervention MEP amplitudes were significantly 
      larger in the IG but not in the CG. The observed MEP amplitudes changes were 
      positively correlated with FMA-UE changes and with the total amount of 
      robot-assisted therapy. CONCLUSION: The additional robot-assisted therapy induced 
      stronger excitability increases in the intervention group. However, this effect 
      did not transduce to motor performance improvements at behavioral level. Trial

AB  - Brain stimulation combined with intensive therapy may improve hand function in 
      children with perinatal stroke-induced unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP). However, 
      response to therapy varies and underlying neuroplasticity mechanisms remain 
      unclear. Here, we aimed to characterize robotic motor mapping outcomes in 
      children with UCP. Twenty-nine children with perinatal stroke and UCP (median age 
      11 ± 2 years) were compared to 24 typically developing controls (TDC). Robotic, 
      neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation was employed to define bilateral 
      motor maps including area, volume, and peak motor evoked potential (MEP). Map 
      outcomes were compared to the primary clinical outcome of the Jebsen-Taylor Test 
      of Hand Function (JTT). Maps were reliably obtained in the contralesional motor 
      cortex (24/29) but challenging in the lesioned hemisphere (5/29). Within the 
      contralesional M1 of participants with UCP, area and peak MEP amplitude of the 
      unaffected map were larger than the affected map. When comparing bilateral maps 
      within the contralesional M1 in children with UCP to that of TDC, only peak MEP 
      amplitudes were different, being smaller for the affected hand as compared to 
      TDC. We observed correlations between the unaffected map when stimulating the 
      contralesional M1 and function of the unaffected hand. Robotic motor mapping can 
      characterize motor cortex neurophysiology in children with perinatal stroke. Map 
      area and peak MEP amplitude may represent discrete biomarkers of developmental 
      plasticity in the contralesional M1. Correlations between map metrics and hand 
      function suggest clinical relevance and utility in studies of interventional 
      plasticity.

TI  - New procedure of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for 
      central neuropathic pain: a placebo-controlled randomized crossover study.
PG  - 718-728
LID - 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001760 [doi]
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a procedure increasingly 
      used to treat patients with central neuropathic pain, but its efficacy is still 
      under debate. Patients with medically refractory chronic central neuropathic pain 
      were included in 2 randomized phases (active/sham), separated by a wash-out 
      period of 8 weeks. Each phase consisted of 4 consecutive rTMS sessions and a 
      final evaluation session, all separated from one another by 3 weeks. 
      High-frequency (20 Hz) rTMS was delivered over the primary motor cortex (M1) 
      contralateral to the patient's pain using a neuronavigated robotic system. 
      Patients and clinicians assessing outcomes were blinded to treatment allocation 
      during the trial. The primary outcome measured the percentage of pain relief (%R) 
      from baseline. Secondary outcomes were VAS score, Neuropathic Pain Symptom 
      Inventory, analgesic drug consumption, and quality of life (EQ-5D). Thirty-six 
      patients performed the entire study with no adverse effects. The analgesic effect 
      for the main criterion (%R) was significantly higher in the active (33.8% 
      confidence interval [CI]: [23.88-43.74]) than in the sham phase (13.02% CI: 
      [6.64-19.76]). This was also the case for the secondary outcome VAS (-19.34% CI: 
      [14.31-25.27] vs -4.83% CI: [1.96-8.18]). No difference was observed for quality 
      of life or analgesic drug consumption. Seventeen patients (47%) were identified 
      as responders, but no significant interaction was found between clinical and 
      technical factors considered here and the analgesic response. These results 
      provide strong evidence that 3 weeks spaced high-frequency rTMS of M1 results in 
      a sustained analgesic effect and support the clinical interest of this 
      stimulation paradigm to treat refractory chronic pain.

TI  - Rehabilitation of Upper Limb Motor Impairment in Stroke: A Narrative Review on 
      the Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Economic Statistics of Stroke and State of the 
      Art Therapies.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10020190 [doi]
LID - 190
AB  - Stroke has been one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and is still a 
      social health issue. Keeping in view the importance of physical rehabilitation of 
      stroke patients, an analytical review has been compiled in which different 
      therapies have been reviewed for their effectiveness, such as functional electric 
      stimulation (FES), noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) including transcranial 
      direct current stimulation (t-DCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (t-MS), 
      invasive epidural cortical stimulation, virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation, 
      task-oriented therapy, robot-assisted training, tele rehabilitation, and cerebral 
      plasticity for the rehabilitation of upper extremity motor impairment. New 
      therapeutic rehabilitation techniques are also being investigated, such as VR. 
      This literature review mainly focuses on the randomized controlled studies, 
      reviews, and statistical meta-analyses associated with motor rehabilitation after 
      stroke. Moreover, with the increasing prevalence rate and the adverse 
      socio-economic consequences of stroke, a statistical analysis covering its 
      economic factors such as treatment, medication and post-stroke care services, and 
      risk factors (modifiable and non-modifiable) have also been discussed. This 
      review suggests that if the prevalence rate of the disease remains persistent, a 
      considerable increase in the stroke population is expected by 2025, causing a 
      substantial economic burden on society, as the survival rate of stroke is high 
      compared to other diseases. Compared to all the other therapies, VR has now 
      emerged as the modern approach towards rehabilitation motor activity of impaired 
      limbs. A range of randomized controlled studies and experimental trials were 
      reviewed to analyse the effectiveness of VR as a rehabilitative treatment with 
      considerable satisfactory results. However, more clinical controlled trials are 
      required to establish a strong evidence base for VR to be widely accepted as a 
      preferred rehabilitation therapy for stroke.

TI  - Case studies in neuroscience: deep brain stimulation changes upper limb cortical 
      motor maps in dystonia.
PG  - 268-273
LID - 10.1152/jn.00159.2020 [doi]
AB  - Deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi-DBS) is an 
      effective treatment for primary dystonia; however, its therapeutic mechanism is 
      poorly understood. Because improvement is gradual, GPi-DBS treatment likely 
      involves short- and long-term mechanisms. Abnormal plasticity resulting in 
      somatotopic reorganization is involved in the development of dystonia and has 
      been proposed as a possible mechanism for this gradual improvement, yet it has 
      not been directly investigated. We hypothesized that GPi-DBS will lead to 
      progressive changes in the cortical representations (motor maps) of upper limb 
      muscles. Neuronavigated robotic transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to map 
      the cortical representation of five upper limb muscles in six healthy controls 
      and a 45-yr-old female cervical dystonia patient before (Pre) and at four time 
      points (Post5 to Post314), 5 to 314 days after GPi-DBS. Motor map area and volume 
      decreased in all muscles following GPi-DBS, while changes in overlap and center 
      of gravity distance between muscles were variable. Despite these motor map 
      changes, only dystonic tremor improved after a year of DBS; neck position 
      worsened slightly. These preliminary findings suggest that GPi-DBS may reduce the 
      cortical representation and excitability of upper limb muscles in dystonia and 
      that these changes can occur without clinical improvement.NEW & NOTEWORTHY 
      Neuronavigated robotic transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to investigate 
      changes in upper limb muscle representation in a cervical dystonia patient before 
      and at four time points up to 314 days after globus pallidus pars interna deep 
      brain stimulation (GPi-DBS). GPi-DBS altered excitability and motor cortical 
      representation of upper limb muscles; however, these changes were not associated 
      with clinical improvement.

TI  - Neglect syndrome in post-stroke conditions: assessment and treatment (scoping 
      review).
PG  - 3-14

AB  - There is no consensus about the definition or most effective treatment for 
      neglect syndrome. The aim of this review was therefore to evaluate the results of 
      trials that investigated different treatment methods for neglect syndrome. A 
      systematic literature search in PubMed and Web of Science databases was performed 
      to identify studies that investigated the effects of neglect therapies. Authors 
      followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
      statement. Studies were selected by two assayers, and disagreement was resolved 
      by a third reviewer. The literature search identified 202 articles: 19 met the 
      inclusion criteria and were included for data extraction. Thirty-five different 
      kinds of assessments were used in these studies, and 17 treatment methods were 
      applied. Successful treatments were reported at least in some parts of the 
      assessments in 12 studies: mirror therapy (in two trials), transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation, street crossing test in virtual reality, smooth pursuit eye movement 
      training, saccadic eye movement therapy, direct current stimulation, eye patching 
      therapy, prism adaptation treatment, socially assistive pet-type therapeutic 
      robot (PARO), Kinesiological Instrument for Normal and Altered Reaching Movement 
      robotic device therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and 
      optokinetic stimulation (the last two methods in the same trial). No success was 
      shown in seven trials, which contained not only single treatments but combined 
      ones also. Authors concluded that there are no convincing results for or against 
      any of the different therapies used for neglect syndrome. The quality of the 
      trials is questionable, and the numbers of included patients are small in the 
      trials.

TI  - Low-frequency transcranial stimulation of pre-supplementary motor area alleviates 
      levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease: a randomized cross-over 
      trial.
PG  - fcaa147

AB  - Levodopa-induced dyskinesia gradually emerges during long-term dopamine therapy, 
      causing major disability in patients with Parkinson disease. Using 
      pharmacodynamic functional MRI, we have previously shown that the intake of 
      levodopa triggers an excessive activation of the pre-supplementary motor area in 
      Parkinson disease patients with peak-of-dose dyskinesia. In this pre-registered, 
      interventional study, we tested whether the abnormal responsiveness of the 
      pre-supplementary motor area to levodopa may constitute a 'stimulation target' 
      for treating dyskinesia. A gender-balanced group of 17 Parkinson disease patients 
      with peak-of-dose dyskinesia received 30 min of robot-assisted repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation, after they had paused their anti-Parkinson 
      medication. Real-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation at 100% or 
      sham-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation at 30% of individual resting 
      corticomotor threshold of left first dorsal interosseous muscle was applied on 
      separate days in counterbalanced order. Following repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation, patients took 200 mg of oral levodopa and underwent 
      functional MRI to map brain activity, while they performed the same go/no-go task 
      as in our previous study. Blinded video assessment revealed that real-repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation delayed the onset of dyskinesia and reduced its 
      severity relative to sham-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. 
      Individual improvement in dyskinesia severity scaled linearly with the modulatory 
      effect of real-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on task-related 
      activation in the pre-supplementary motor area. Stimulation-induced delay in 
      dyskinesia onset correlated positively with the induced electrical field strength 
      in the pre-supplementary motor area. Our results provide converging evidence that 
      the levodopa-triggered increase in pre-supplementary motor area activity plays a 
      causal role in the pathophysiology of peak-of-dose dyskinesia and constitutes a 
      promising cortical target for brain stimulation therapy.

AB  - Introduction: Innovative motor therapies have attempted to reduce upper extremity 
      impairment after stroke but have not made substantial improvement as over 50% of 
      people post-stroke continue to have sensorimotor deficits affecting their 
      self-care and participation in daily activities. Intervention studies have 
      focused on the role of increased dosing, however recent studies have indicated 
      that timing of rehabilitation interventions may be as important as dosing and 
      importantly, that dosing and timing interact in mediating effectiveness. This 
      study is designed to empirically test dosing and timing. Methods and Analysis: In 
      this single-blinded, interventional study, subjects will be stratified on two 
      dimensions, impairment level (Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment (FM) and 
      presence or absence of Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) as follows; (1) Severe, FM 
      score 10-19, MEP+, (2) Severe, FM score 10-19, MEP-, (3) Moderate, FM score 
      20-49, MEP+, (4) Moderate, FM score 20-49, MEP-. Subjects not eligible for TMS 
      will be assigned to either group 2 (if severe) or group 3 (if moderate). 
      Stratified block randomization will then be used to achieve a balanced 
      assignment. Early Robotic/VR Therapy (EVR) experimental group will receive 
      in-patient usual care therapy plus an extra 10 h of intensive upper extremity 
      therapy focusing on the hand using robotically facilitated rehabilitation 
      interventions presented in virtual environments and initiated 5-30 days 
      post-stroke. Delayed Robotic/VR Therapy (DVR) experimental group will receive the 
      same intervention but initiated 30-60 days post-stroke. Dose-matched usual care 
      group (DMUC) will receive an extra 10 h of usual care initiated 5-30 days 
      post-stroke. Usual Care Group (UC) will receive the usual amount of 
      physical/occupational therapy. Outcomes: There are clinical, neurophysiological, 
      and kinematic/kinetic measures, plus measures of daily arm use and quality of 
      life. Primary outcome is the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) measured at 4 months 
      post-stroke. Discussion: Outcome measures will be assessed to determine whether 
      there is an early time period in which rehabilitation will be most effective, and 
      whether there is a difference in the recapture of premorbid patterns of movement 
      vs. the development of an efficient, but compensatory movement strategy. Ethical 
      Considerations: The IRBs of New Jersey Institute of Technology, Rutgers 
      University, Northeastern University, and Kessler Foundation reviewed and approved 
      all study protocols. Study was registered in https://ClinicalTrials.gov 
      (NCT03569059) prior to recruitment. Dissemination will include submission to 
      peer-reviewed journals and professional presentations.

TI  - Somatosensory changes associated with motor skill learning.
PG  - 1052-1062
LID - 10.1152/jn.00497.2019 [doi]
AB  - Trial-and-error motor adaptation has been linked to somatosensory plasticity and 
      shifts in proprioception (limb position sense). The role of sensory processing in 
      motor skill learning is less understood. Unlike adaptation, skill learning 
      involves the acquisition of new movement patterns in the absence of perturbation, 
      with performance limited by the speed-accuracy trade-off. We investigated 
      somatosensory changes during motor skill learning at the behavioral and 
      neurophysiological levels. Twenty-eight healthy young adults practiced a 
      maze-tracing task, guiding a robotic manipulandum through an irregular 
      two-dimensional track featuring several abrupt turns. Practice occurred on days 1 
      and 2. Skill was assessed before practice on day 1 and again on day 3, with 
      learning indicated by a shift in the speed-accuracy function between these 
      assessments. Proprioceptive function was quantified with a passive 
      two-alternative forced-choice task. In a subset of 15 participants, we measured 
      short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) to index somatosensory projections to 
      motor cortex. We found that motor practice enhanced the speed-accuracy skill 
      function (F(4,108) = 32.15, P < 0.001) and was associated with improved 
      proprioceptive sensitivity at retention (t(22) = 24.75, P = 0.0031). Furthermore, 
      SAI increased after training (F(1,14) = 5.41, P = 0.036). Interestingly, 
      individuals with larger increases in SAI, reflecting enhanced somatosensory 
      afference to motor cortex, demonstrated larger improvements in motor skill 
      learning. These findings suggest that SAI may be an important functional 
      mechanism for some aspect of motor skill learning. Further research is needed to 
      test what parameters (task complexity, practice time, etc.) are specifically 
      linked to somatosensory function.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Somatosensory processing has 
      been implicated in motor adaptation, where performance recovers from a 
      perturbation such as a force field. We investigated somatosensory function during 
      motor skill learning, where a new motor pattern is acquired in the absence of 
      perturbation. After skill practice, we found changes in proprioception and 
      short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), signifying somatosensory change at both 
      the behavioral and neurophysiological levels. SAI may be an important functional 
      mechanism by which individuals learn motor skills.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanism of stroke recovery is related to the reorganization of 
      cerebral activity that can be enhanced by rehabilitation therapy. Two well 
      established treatments are Robot-Assisted Therapy (RT) and Constraint-Induced 
      Movement Therapy (CIMT), however, it is unknown whether there is a difference in 
      the neuroplastic changes induced by these therapies, and if the modifications are 
      related to motor improvement. Therefore, this study aims to identify 
      neurophysiological biomarkers related to motor improvement of participants with 
      chronic stroke that received RT or CIMT, and to test whether there is a 
      difference in neuronal changes induced by these two therapies. METHODS: This 
      study included participants with chronic stroke that took part in a pilot 
      experiment to compare CIMT vs. RT. Neurophysiological evaluations were performed 
      with electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), 
      pre and post rehabilitation therapy. Motor function was measured by the Wolf 
      Motor Function Test (WMFT) and Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Limb (FMA-UL). 
      RESULTS: Twenty-seven participants with chronic stroke completed the present 
      study [mean age of 58.8 years (SD ± 13.6), mean time since stroke of 18.2 months 
      (SD ± 9.6)]. We found that changes in motor threshold (MT) and motor evoked 
      potential (MEP) in the lesioned hemisphere have a positive and negative 
      correlation with WMFT improvement, respectively. The absolute change in alpha 
      peak in the unlesioned hemisphere and the absolute change of the alpha ratio 
      (unlesioned/lesioned hemisphere) is negatively correlated with WMFT improvement. 
      The decrease of EEG power ratio (increase in the lesioned hemisphere and decrease 
      in the unlesioned hemisphere) for high alpha bandwidths is correlated with better 
      improvement in WMFT. The variable "type of treatment (RT or CIMT)" was not 
      significant in the models. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that distinct 
      treatments (RT and CIMT) have similar neuroplastic mechanisms of recovery. 
      Moreover, motor improvements in participants with chronic stroke are related to 
      decreases of cortical excitability in the lesioned hemisphere measured with TMS. 
      Furthermore, the balance of both EEG power and EEG alpha peak frequency in the 
      lesioned hemisphere is related to motor improvement.

AB  - Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer the potential to facilitate 
      neurorehabilitation in stroke patients by decoding user intentions from the 
      central nervous system, thereby enabling control over external devices. Despite 
      their promise, the diverse range of intervention parameters and technical 
      challenges in clinical settings have hindered the accumulation of substantial 
      evidence supporting the efficacy and effectiveness of BCIs in stroke 
      rehabilitation. This article introduces a practical guide designed to navigate 
      through these challenges in conducting BCI interventions for stroke 
      rehabilitation. Applicable regardless of infrastructure and study design 
      limitations, this guide acts as a comprehensive reference for executing BCI-based 
      stroke interventions. Furthermore, it encapsulates insights gleaned from 
      administering hundreds of BCI rehabilitation sessions to stroke 
      patients.•Presents a comprehensive methodology for implementing BCI-based upper 
      extremity therapy in stroke patients.•Provides detailed guidance on the number of 
      sessions, trials, as well as the necessary hardware and software for effective 
      intervention.

TI  - Brain-Computer Interface Coupled to a Robotic Hand Orthosis for Stroke Patients' 
      Neurorehabilitation: A Crossover Feasibility Study.

LID - 656975
AB  - Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) coupled to robotic assistive devices have shown 
      promise for the rehabilitation of stroke patients. However, little has been 
      reported that compares the clinical and physiological effects of a BCI 
      intervention for upper limb stroke rehabilitation with those of conventional 
      therapy. This study assesses the feasibility of an intervention with a BCI based 
      on electroencephalography (EEG) coupled to a robotic hand orthosis for upper limb 
      stroke rehabilitation and compares its outcomes to conventional therapy. Seven 
      subacute and three chronic stroke patients (M = 59.9 ± 12.8) with severe upper 
      limb impairment were recruited in a crossover feasibility study to receive 1 
      month of BCI therapy and 1 month of conventional therapy in random order. The 
      outcome measures were comprised of: Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity 
      (FMA-UE), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), motor evoked potentials elicited by 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), hand dynamometry, and EEG. Additionally, 
      BCI performance and user experience were measured. All measurements were acquired 
      before and after each intervention. FMA-UE and ARAT after BCI (23.1 ± 16; 8.4 ± 
      10) and after conventional therapy (21.9 ± 15; 8.7 ± 11) were significantly 
      higher (p < 0.017) compared to baseline (17.5 ± 15; 4.3 ± 6) but were similar 
      between therapies (p > 0.017). Via TMS, corticospinal tract integrity could be 
      assessed in the affected hemisphere of three patients at baseline, in five after 
      BCI, and four after conventional therapy. While no significant difference (p > 
      0.05) was found in patients' affected hand strength, it was higher after the BCI 
      therapy. EEG cortical activations were significantly higher over motor and 
      non-motor regions after both therapies (p < 0.017). System performance increased 
      across BCI sessions, from 54 (50, 70%) to 72% (56, 83%). Patients reported 
      moderate mental workloads and excellent usability with the BCI. Outcome 
      measurements implied that a BCI intervention using a robotic hand orthosis as 
      feedback has the potential to elicit neuroplasticity-related mechanisms, similar 
      to those observed during conventional therapy, even in a group of severely 
      impaired stroke patients. Therefore, the proposed BCI system could be a suitable 
      therapy option and will be further assessed in clinical trials.

      deficits: A review of devices and their effects on muscle activation, neural 
      control, and gait mechanics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Injuries to the neuromusculoskeletal system often result in weakness 
      and gait impairments. Functional resistance training during walking-where 
      patients walk while a device increases loading on the leg-is an emerging approach 
      to combat these symptoms. However, there are many methods that can be used to 
      resist the patient, which may alter the biomechanics of the training. Thus, all 
      methods may not address patient-specific deficits. METHODS: We performed a 
      comprehensive electronic database search to identify articles that acutely (i.e., 
      after a single training session) examined how functional resistance training 
      during walking alters muscle activation, gait biomechanics, and neural 
      plasticity. Only articles that examined these effects during training or 
      following the removal of resistance (i.e., aftereffects) were included. FINDINGS: 
      We found 41 studies that matched these criteria. Most studies (24) used passive 
      devices (e.g., weighted cuffs or resistance bands) while the remainder used 
      robotic devices. Devices varied on if they were wearable (14) or externally 
      tethered, and the type of resistance they applied (i.e., inertial [14], elastic 
      [8], viscous [7], or customized [12]). Notably, these methods provided 
      device-specific changes in muscle activation, biomechanics, and spatiotemporal 
      and kinematic aftereffects. Some evidence suggests this training results in 
      task-specific increases in neural excitability. INTERPRETATION: These findings 
      suggest that careful selection of resistive strategies could help target 
      patient-specific strength deficits and gait impairments. Also, many approaches 
      are low-cost and feasible for clinical or in-home use. The results provide new 
      insights for clinicians on selecting an appropriate functional resistance 
      training strategy to target patient-specific needs.

TI  - A Review of Current Perspectives on Motoric Insufficiency Rehabilitation 
      following Pediatric Stroke.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare12020149 [doi]
LID - 149
AB  - Pediatric stroke (PS) is an injury caused by the occlusion or rupture of a blood 
      vessel in the central nervous system (CNS) of children, before or after birth. 
      Hemiparesis is the most common motoric deficit associated with PS in children. 
      Therefore, it is important to emphasize that PS is a significant challenge for 
      rehabilitation, especially since the consequences may also appear during the 
      child's growth and development, reducing functional capacity. The plasticity of 
      the child's CNS is an important predecessor of recovery, but disruption of the 
      neural network, specific to an immature brain, can have harmful and potentially 
      devastating consequences. In this review, we summarize the complexity of the 
      consequences associated with PS and the possibilities and role of modern 
      rehabilitation. An analysis of the current literature reveals that 
      Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy, forced-use therapy, repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation, functional electrical stimulation and robot-assisted 
      therapy have demonstrated at least partial improvements in motor domains related 
      to hemiparesis or hemiplegia caused by PS, but they are supported with different 
      levels of evidence. Due to the lack of randomized controlled studies, the optimal 
      rehabilitation treatment is still debatable, and therefore, most recommendations 
      are primarily based on expert consensuses, opinions and an insufficient level of 
      evidence.

AB  - Robot-assisted rehabilitation (RAR) and non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) are 
      interventions that, both individually and combined, can significantly enhance 
      motor performance after spinal cord injury (SCI). We sought to determine whether 
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with active 
      transvertebral direct current stimulation (tvDCS) (namely, NIBS) in association 
      with RAR (RAR + NIBS) improves lower extremity motor function more than RAR alone 
      in subjects with motor incomplete SCI (iSCI). Fifteen adults with iSCI received 
      one daily session of RAR+NIBS in the early afternoon, six sessions weekly, for 
      eight consecutive weeks. Outcome measures included the 6 min walk test (6MWT), 
      the 10 m walk test (10MWT), the timed up and go (TUG) to test mobility and 
      balance, the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI II), the Functional 
      Independence Measure-Locomotion (FIM-L), the manual muscle testing for lower 
      extremity motor score (LEMS), the modified Ashworth scale for lower limbs (MAS), 
      and the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. The data of these subjects were 
      compared with those of 20 individuals matched for clinical and demographic 
      features who previously received the same amount or RAR without NIBS (RAR - 
      NIBS). All patients completed the trial, and none reported any side effects 
      either during or following the training. The 10MWT improved in both groups, but 
      the increase was significantly greater following RAR + NIBS than RAR - NIBS. The 
      same occurred for the FIM-L, LEMS, and WISCI II. No significant differences were 
      appreciable concerning the 6MWT and TUG. Conversely, RAR - NIBS outperformed RAR 
      + NIBS regarding the MAS and VAS. Pairing tvDCS with rTMS during RAR can improve 
      lower extremity motor function more than RAR alone can do. Future research with a 
      larger sample size is recommended to determine longer-term effects on motor 
      function and activities of daily living.

TI  - Brain State-dependent Gain Modulation of Corticospinal Output in the Active Motor 
      System.
PG  - 371-381
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhz093 [doi]
AB  - The communication through coherence hypothesis suggests that only coherently 
      oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively and predicts an intrinsic 
      response modulation along the oscillatory rhythm. For the motor cortex (MC) at 
      rest, the oscillatory cycle has been shown to determine the brain's 
      responsiveness to external stimuli. For the active MC, however, the demonstration 
      of such a phase-specific modulation of corticospinal excitability (CSE) along the 
      rhythm cycle is still missing. Motor evoked potentials in response to 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the MC were used to probe the effect 
      of cortical oscillations on CSE during several motor conditions. A brain-machine 
      interface (BMI) with a robotic hand orthosis allowed investigating effects of 
      cortical activity on CSE without the confounding effects of voluntary muscle 
      activation. Only this BMI approach (and not active or passive hand opening alone) 
      revealed a frequency- and phase-specific cortical modulation of CSE by 
      sensorimotor beta-band activity that peaked once per oscillatory cycle and was 
      independent of muscle activity. The active MC follows an intrinsic response 
      modulation in accordance with the communication through coherence hypothesis. 
      Furthermore, the BMI approach may facilitate and strengthen effective 
      corticospinal communication in a therapeutic context, for example, when voluntary 
      hand opening is no longer possible after stroke.

AB  - For achieving motor recovery in individuals with sensorimotor deficits, augmented 
      activation of the appropriate sensorimotor system, and facilitated induction of 
      neural plasticity are essential. An emerging procedure that combines peripheral 
      nerve stimulation and its associative stimulation with central brain stimulation 
      is known to enhance the excitability of the motor cortex. In order to effectively 
      apply this paired stimulation technique, timing between central and peripheral 
      stimuli must be individually adjusted. There is a small range of effective 
      timings between two stimuli, or the inter-stimulus interval window (ISI-W). 
      Properties of ISI-W from neuromodulation in response to mechanical stimulation 
      (Mstim) of muscles have been understudied because of the absence of a versatile 
      and reliable mechanical stimulator. This paper adopted a combination of 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and Mstim by using a high-precision 
      robotic mechanical stimulator. A pneumatically operated robotic tendon tapping 
      device was applied. A low-friction linear cylinder achieved high stimulation 
      precision in time and low electromagnetic artifacts in physiological 
      measurements. This paper describes a procedure to effectively estimate an 
      individual ISI-W from the transiently enhanced motor evoked potential (MEP) with 
      a reduced number of paired Mstim and sub-threshold TMS trials by applying 
      statistical sampling and regression technique. This paper applied a total of four 
      parametric and non-parametric statistical regression methods for ISI-W 
      estimation. The developed procedure helps to reduce time for individually 
      adjusting effective ISI, reducing physical burden on the subject.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study motor cortex plasticity after a period of training with a new 
      prototype of bidirectional hand prosthesis in three left trans-radial amputees, 
      correlating these changes with the modification of Phantom Limb Pain (PLP) in the 
      same period. METHODS: Each subject underwent a brain motor mapping with 
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and PLP evaluation with questionnaires 
      during a six-month training with a prototype of bidirectional hand prosthesis. 
      RESULTS: The baseline motor maps showed in all three amputees a smaller area of 
      muscles representation of the amputated side compared to the intact limb. After 
      training, there was a partial reversal of the baseline asymmetry. The two 
      subjects affected by PLP experienced a statistically significant reduction of 
      pain. CONCLUSIONS: Two apparently opposite findings, the invasion of the 
      "deafferented" cortex by neighbouring areas and the "persistence" of neural 
      structures after amputation, could vary according to different target used for 
      measurement. Our results do not support a correlation between PLP and motor 
      cortical changes. SIGNIFICANCE: The selection of the target and of the task is 
      essential for studies investigating motor brain plasticity. This study boosts 
      against a direct and unique role of motor cortical changes on PLP genesis.

TI  - Modulatory Effects of Communicative Gaze on Attentional Orienting Are Driven by

PG  - 1670-1680
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_02032 [doi]
AB  - Communicative gaze (e.g., mutual or averted) has been shown to affect attentional 
      orienting. However, no study to date has clearly separated the neural basis of 
      the pure social component that modulates attentional orienting in response to 
      communicative gaze from other processes that might be a combination of 
      attentional and social effects. We used TMS to isolate the purely social effects 
      of communicative gaze on attentional orienting. Participants completed a 
      gaze-cueing task with a humanoid robot who engaged either in mutual or in averted 
      gaze before shifting its gaze. Before the task, participants received either sham 
      stimulation (baseline), stimulation of right TPJ (rTPJ), or dorsomedial 
      prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Results showed, as expected, that communicative gaze 
      affected attentional orienting in baseline condition. This effect was not evident 
      for rTPJ stimulation. Interestingly, stimulation to rTPJ also canceled out 
      attentional orienting altogether. On the other hand, dmPFC stimulation eliminated 
      the socially driven difference in attention orienting between the two gaze 
      conditions while maintaining the basic general attentional orienting effect. 
      Thus, our results allowed for separation of the pure social effect of 
      communicative gaze on attentional orienting from other processes that are a 
      combination of social and generic attentional components.

      review].
PG  - 42-53

AB  - Stroke is the world's second leading cause of death and the first cause of 
      disability among all diseases. The most common complication of a stroke is a 
      violation of the motor function of the limbs, which significantly worsens the 
      quality of life and the level of self-care and independence of patients. 
      Restoring the function of the upper limb is one of the priority tasks of 
      rehabilitation after a stroke. A large number of factors, such as the location 
      and size of the primary brain lesion, the presence of complications in the form 
      of spasticity, impaired skin and proprioceptive sensitivity, and comorbidities, 
      determine the patient's rehabilitation potential and the prognosis of ongoing 
      rehabilitation measures. Of particular note are the timing of the start of 
      rehabilitation measures, the duration and regularity of the treatment methods. A 
      number of authors propose scales for assessing the rehabilitation prognosis, as 
      well as algorithms for compiling rehabilitation programs for restoring the 
      function of the upper limb. A fairly large number of rehabilitation methods and 
      their combinations have been proposed, including special methods of 
      kinesitherapy, robotic mechanotherapy with biofeedback, the use of 
      physiotherapeutic factors, manual and reflex effects, as well as ready-made 
      programs that include sequential and combined use of various methods. Dozens of 
      studies have been devoted to comparative analysis and evaluation of the 
      effectiveness of these methods. The purpose of this work is to review current 
      research on a given topic and draw up our own conclusion on the appropriateness 
      of using and combining these methods at various stages of rehabilitation in 
      stroke patients.

TI  - Effects of Robotic Therapy Associated With Noninvasive Brain Stimulation on 
      Upper-Limb Rehabilitation After Stroke: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of 
      Randomized Clinical Trials.
PG  - 256-266
LID - 10.1177/1545968321989353 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted therapy and noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) are 
      promising strategies for stroke rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review 
      and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the evidence of NIBS as an add-on intervention 
      to robotic therapy in order to improve outcomes of upper-limb motor impairment or 
      activity in individuals with stroke. METHODS: This study was performed according 
      to the PRISMA Protocol and was previously registered on the PROSPERO Platform 
      (CRD42017054563). Seven databases and gray literature were systematically 
      searched by 2 reviewers, and 1176 registers were accessed. Eight randomized 
      clinical trials with upper-limb body structure/function or activity limitation 
      outcome measures were included. Subgroup analyses were performed according to 
      phase poststroke, device characteristics (ie, arm support, joints involved, 
      unimanual or bimanual training), NIBS paradigm, timing of stimulation, and number 
      of sessions. The Grade-Pro Software was used to assess quality of the evidence. 
      RESULTS: A nonsignificant homogeneous summary effect size was found both for body 
      structure function domain (mean difference [MD] = 0.15; 95% CI = -3.10 to 3.40; P 
      = 0.93; I(2) = 0%) and activity limitation domain (standard MD = 0.03; 95% CI = 
      -0.28 to 0.33; P = 0.87; I(2) = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: According to this systematic 
      review and meta-analysis, at the moment, there are not enough data about the 
      benefits of NIBS as an add-on intervention to robot-assisted therapy on 
      upper-limb motor function or activity in individuals with stroke.

TI  - Emerging of new bioartificial corticospinal motor synergies using a robotic 
      additional thumb.
PG  - 18487

AB  - It is likely that when using an artificially augmented hand with six fingers, the 
      natural five plus a robotic one, corticospinal motor synergies controlling 
      grasping actions might be different. However, no direct neurophysiological 
      evidence for this reasonable assumption is available yet. We used transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex to directly address this issue 
      during motor imagery of objects' grasping actions performed with or without the 
      Soft Sixth Finger (SSF). The SSF is a wearable robotic additional thumb patented 
      for helping patients with hand paresis and inherent loss of thumb opposition 
      abilities. To this aim, we capitalized from the solid notion that neural circuits 
      and mechanisms underlying motor imagery overlap those of physiological voluntary 
      actions. After a few minutes of training, healthy humans wearing the SSF rapidly 
      reshaped the pattern of corticospinal outputs towards forearm and hand muscles 
      governing imagined grasping actions of different objects, suggesting the 
      possibility that the extra finger might rapidly be encoded into the user's body 
      schema, which is integral part of the frontal-parietal grasping network. Such 
      neural signatures might explain how the motor system of human beings is open to 
      very quickly welcoming emerging augmentative bioartificial corticospinal grasping 
      strategies. Such an ability might represent the functional substrate of a final 
      common pathway the brain might count on towards new interactions with the 
      surrounding objects within the peripersonal space. Findings provide a 
      neurophysiological framework for implementing augmentative robotic tools in 
      humans and for the exploitation of the SSF in conceptually new rehabilitation 
      settings.

TI  - Adjunctive neuronavigated accelerated continuous theta-burst stimulation in 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder: a randomized sham-controlled study.
PG  - 1-10

AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 40% of patients treated for obsessive-compulsive 
      disorder (OCD) do not respond to standard and second-line augmentation treatments 
      leading to the exploration of alternate biological treatments. Continuous theta 
      burst stimulation (cTBS) is a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation inducing more rapid and longer-lasting effects on synaptic plasticity 
      than the latter. To the best of our knowledge, only one recent study and a case 
      report investigated the effect of cTBS at the supplementary motor area (SMA) in 
      OCD. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effect of accelerated robotized 
      neuronavigated cTBS over SMA in patients with OCD. METHODS: A total of 32 
      patients with OCD were enrolled and randomized into active and sham cTBS groups. 
      For active cTBS stimulation, an accelerated protocol was used. Bursts of three 
      stimuli at 50 Hz, at 80% of MT, repeated at 5 Hz were used. Daily 2 sessions of 
      900 pulses each, for a total of 30 sessions over 3 wk (weekly 10 sessions), were 
      given. Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Rating Scale (YBOCS), Clinical Global 
      Impressions scale (CGI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and Hamilton 
      Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) were administered at baseline and at end of weeks 3 
      and 8. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients completed the study. Active cTBS group 
      showed significant group × time effect in YBOCS obsession (P < .001, 
      η(2) = 0.288), compulsion (P = .004, η(2) = 0.207), YBOCS total (P < .001, 
      η(2) = 0.288), CGI-S (P = .010, η(2) = 0.248), CGI-C (P = .010, η(2) = 0.248), 
      HAM-D (P = .014, η(2) = 0.224) than sham cTBS group. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from 
      our study suggest that adjunctive accelerated cTBS significantly improves 
      psychopathology, severity of illness, and depression among patients with OCD. 
      Future studies with larger sample sizes will add to our knowledge.

TI  - Effects of robotic therapy associated with noninvasive brain stimulation on motor 
      function in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury: A systematic review 
      of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1080/10790268.2024.2304921 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Motor deficits are among the most common consequences of incomplete 
      spinal cord injury (SCI). These impairments can affect patients' levels of 
      functioning and quality of life. Combined robotic therapy and non-invasive brain 
      stimulation (NIBS) have been used to improve motor impairments in patients with 
      corticospinal tract lesions. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of combined 
      robotic therapy and NIBS on motor function post incomplete SCI. METHODS: PubMed, 
      SCOPUS, MEDLINE, PEDro, Web of Science, REHABDATA, CINAHL, and EMBASE were 
      searched from inception until July 2023. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database 
      (PEDro) scale was employed to evaluate the selected studies quality. RESULTS: Of 
      557 studies, five randomized trials (n = 122), with 25% of participants being 
      females, were included in this review. The PEDro scores ranged from eight to 
      nine, with a median score of nine. There were variations in treatment protocols 
      and outcome measures, resulting in heterogeneous findings. The findings showed 
      revealed evidence for the impacts of combined robotic therapy and NIBS on motor 
      function in individuals with incomplete SCI. CONCLUSIONS: Combined robotic 
      training and NIBS may be safe for individuals with incomplete SCI. The existing 
      evidence concerning its effects on motor outcomes in individuals with SCI is 
      limited. Further experimental studies are needed to understand the effects of 
      combined robotic training and NIBS on motor impairments in SCI populations.

AB  - Background: Given the limited healthcare resources in low and middle income 
      countries (LMICs), effective rehabilitation strategies that can be realistically 
      adopted in such settings are required. Objective: A systematic review of 
      literature was conducted to identify pragmatic solutions and outcomes capable of 
      enhancing stroke recovery and quality of life of stroke survivors for low- and 
      middle- income countries. Methods: PubMed, HINARI, and Directory of Open Access 
      Journals databases were searched for published Randomized Controlled Trials 
      (RCTs) till November 2018. Only completed trials published in English with 
      non-pharmacological interventions on adult stroke survivors were included in the 
      review while published protocols, pilot studies and feasibility analysis of 
      trials were excluded. Obtained data were synthesized thematically and 
      descriptively analyzed. Results: One thousand nine hundred and ninety six studies 
      were identified while 347 (65.22% high quality) RCTs were found to be eligible 
      for the review. The most commonly assessed variables (and outcome measure 
      utility) were activities of daily living [75.79% of the studies, with Barthel 
      Index (37.02%)], motor function [66.57%; with Fugl Meyer scale (71.88%)], and 
      gait [31.12%; with 6 min walk test (38.67%)]. Majority of the innovatively high 
      technology interventions such as robot therapy (95.24%), virtual reality 
      (94.44%), transcranial direct current stimulation (78.95%), transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (88.0%) and functional electrical stimulation (85.00%) were conducted 
      in high income countries. Several traditional and low-cost interventions such as 
      constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), resistant and aerobic exercises 
      (R&AE), task oriented therapy (TOT), body weight supported treadmill training 
      (BWSTT) were reported to significantly contribute to the recovery of motor 
      function, activity, participation, and improvement of quality of life after 
      stroke. Conclusion: Several pragmatic, in terms of affordability, accessibility 
      and utility, stroke rehabilitation solutions, and outcome measures that can be 
      used in resource-limited settings were found to be effective in facilitating and 
      enhancing post-stroke recovery and quality of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of unilateral, proximal arm robot-assisted 
      therapy combined with hand functional electrical stimulation with intensive 
      conventional therapy for restoring arm function in survivors of subacute stroke. 
      DESIGN: This was a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: 
      Inpatient rehabilitation university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=40) 
      diagnosed as having ischemic stroke (time since stroke <8wk) and upper limb 
      impairment were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Participants randomized to the 
      experimental group received 30 sessions (5 sessions/wk) of robot-assisted arm 
      therapy and hand functional electrical stimulation (RAT+FES). Participants 
      randomized to the control group received a time-matched intensive conventional 
      therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was arm motor recovery 
      measured with the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment. Secondary outcomes included motor 
      function, arm spasticity, and activities of daily living. Measurements were 
      performed at baseline, after 3 weeks, at the end of treatment, and at 6-month 
      follow-up. Presence of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) was also measured at 
      baseline. RESULTS: Both groups significantly improved all outcome measures except 
      for spasticity without differences between groups. Patients with moderate 
      impairment and presence of MEPs who underwent early rehabilitation (<30d post 
      stroke) demonstrated the greatest clinical improvements. CONCLUSIONS: RAT+FES was 
      no more effective than intensive conventional arm training. However, at the same 
      level of arm impairment and corticospinal tract integrity, it induced a higher 
      level of arm recovery.

TI  - Industrial Shared Wireless Communication Systems-Use Case of Autonomous Guided 
      Vehicles with Collaborative Robot.
LID - 10.3390/s23010158 [doi]
LID - 158
AB  - Dedicated fieldbuses were developed to provide temporal determinisms for 
      industrial distributed real-time systems. In the early stages, communication 
      systems were dedicated to a single protocol and generally supported a single 
      service. Industrial Ethernet, which is used today, supports many concurrent 
      services, but usually only one real-time protocol at a time. However, shop-floor 
      communication must support a range of different traffic from messages with strict 
      real-time requirements such as time-driven messages with process data and 
      event-driven security messages to diagnostic messages that have more relaxed 
      temporal requirements. Thus, it is necessary to combine different real-time 
      protocols into one communication network. This raises many challenges, especially 
      when the goal is to use wireless communication. There is no research work on that 
      area and this paper attempts to fill in that gap. It is a result of some 
      experiments that were conducted while connecting a Collaborative Robot CoBotAGV 
      with a production station for which two real-time protocols, Profinet and OPC UA, 
      had to be combined into one wireless network interface. The first protocol was 
      for the exchange of processing data, while the latter integrated the vehicle with 
      Manufacturing Execution System (MES) and Transport Management System (TMS). The 
      paper presents the real-time capabilities of such a combination-an achievable 
      communication cycle and jitter.

AB  - Background: Robotic devices have been used to rehabilitate walking function after 
      stroke. Although results suggest that post-stroke patients benefit from this 
      non-conventional therapy, there is no agreement on the optimal robot-assisted 
      approaches to promote neurorecovery. Here we present a new robotic therapy 
      protocol using a grounded exoskeleton perturbing the ankle joint based on tacit 
      learning control. Method: Ten healthy individuals and a post-stroke patient 
      participated in the study and were enrolled in a pilot intervention protocol that 
      involved performance of ankle movements following different trajectories via 
      video game visual feedback. The system autonomously modulated task difficulty 
      according to the performance to increase the challenge. We hypothesized that 
      motor learning throughout training sessions would lead to increased corticospinal 
      excitability of dorsi-plantarflexor muscles. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation 
      was used to assess the effects on corticospinal excitability. Results: 
      Improvements have been observed on task performance and motor outcomes in both 
      healthy individuals and post-stroke patient case study. Tibialis Anterior 
      corticospinal excitability increased significantly after the training; however no 
      significant changes were observed on Soleus corticospinal excitability. Clinical 
      scales showed functional improvements in the stroke patient. Discussion and 
      Significance: Our findings both in neurophysiological and performance assessment 
      suggest improved motor learning. Some limitations of the study include treatment 
      duration and intensity, as well as the non-significant changes in corticospinal 
      excitability obtained for Soleus. Nonetheless, results suggest that this robotic 
      training framework is a potentially interesting approach that can be explored for 
      gait rehabilitation in post-stroke patients.

TI  - Effects of priming intermittent theta burst stimulation on upper limb motor 
      recovery after stroke: study protocol for a proof-of-concept randomised 
      controlled trial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), a form of repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), delivered to the ipsilesional primary 
      motor cortex (M1), appears to enhance the brain's response to rehabilitative 
      training in patients with stroke. However, its clinical utility is highly subject 
      to variability in different protocols. New evidence has reported that preceding 
      iTBS, with continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) may stabilise and even boost 
      the facilitatory effect of iTBS on the stimulated M1, via metaplasticity. The aim 
      of this study is to investigate the effects of iTBS primed with cTBS (ie, priming 
      iTBS), in addition to robot-assisted training (RAT), on the improvement of the 
      hemiparetic upper limb functions of stroke patients and to explore potential 
      sensorimotor neuroplasticity using electroencephalography (EEG). METHODS AND 
      ANALYSIS: A three-arm, subjects and assessors-blinded, randomised controlled 
      trial will be performed with patients with chronic stroke. An estimated sample of 
      36 patients will be needed based on the prior sample size calculation. All 
      participants will be randomly allocated to receive 10 sessions of rTMS with 
      different TBS protocols (cTBS+iTBS, sham cTBS+iTBS and sham cTBS+sham iTBS), 
      three to five sessions per week, for 2-3 weeks. All participants will receive 
      60 min of RAT after each stimulation session. Primary outcomes will be assessed 
      using Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity scores and Action Research Arm Test. 
      Secondary outcomes will be assessed using kinematic outcomes generated during RAT 
      and EEG. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from The 
      Human Subjects Ethics Sub-committee, University Research Committee of The Hong 
      Kong Polytechnic University (reference number: HSEARS20190718003). The results 
      yielded from this study will be presented at international conferences and sent 
      to a peer-review journal to be considered for publication. TRIAL REGISTRATION

TI  - Upper limb sensorimotor recovery in Asian stroke survivors: a study protocol for

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke is a leading cause of lifelong disability worldwide, partially 
      driven by a reduced ability to use the upper limb in daily life causing increased 
      dependence on caregivers. However, post-stroke functional impairments have only 
      been investigated using limited clinical scores, during short-term longitudinal 
      studies in relatively small patient cohorts. With the addition of 
      technology-based assessments, we propose to complement clinical assessments with 
      more sensitive and objective measures that could more holistically inform on 
      upper limb impairment recovery after stroke, its impact on upper limb use in 
      daily life, and on overall quality of life. This paper describes a pragmatic, 
      longitudinal, observational study protocol aiming to gather a uniquely rich 
      multimodal database to comprehensively describe the time course of upper limb 
      recovery in a representative cohort of 400 Asian adults after stroke. 
      Particularly, we will characterize the longitudinal relationship between upper 
      limb recovery, common post-stroke impairments, functional independence and 
      quality of life. METHODS: Participants with stroke will be tested at up to eight 
      time points, from within a month to 3 years post-stroke, to capture the influence 
      of transitioning from hospital to community settings. We will perform a battery 
      of established clinical assessments to describe the factors most likely to 
      influence upper limb recovery. Further, we will gather digital health biomarkers 
      from robotic or wearable sensing technology-assisted assessments to sensitively 
      characterize motor and somatosensory impairments and upper limb use in daily 
      life. We will also use both quantitative and qualitative measures to understand 
      health-related quality of life. Lastly, we will describe neurophysiological motor 
      status using transcranial magnetic stimulation. STATISTICS: Descriptive analyses 
      will be first performed to understand post-stroke upper limb impairments and 
      recovery at various time points. The relationships between digital biomarkers and 
      various domains will be explored to inform key aspects of upper limb recovery and 
      its dynamics using correlation matrices. Multiple statistical models will be 
      constructed to characterize the time course of upper limb recovery post-stroke. 
      Subgroups of stroke survivors exhibiting distinct recovery profiles will be 
      identified. CONCLUSION: This is the first study complementing clinical 
      assessments with technology-assisted digital biomarkers to investigate upper limb 
      sensorimotor recovery in Asian stroke survivors. Overall, this study will yield a 
      multimodal data set that longitudinally characterizes post-stroke upper limb 
      recovery in functional impairments, daily-life upper limb use, and health-related 
      quality of life in a large cohort of Asian stroke survivors. This data set 
      generates valuable information on post-stroke upper limb recovery and potentially 
      allows researchers to identify different recovery profiles of subgroups of Asian 
      stroke survivors. This enables the comparisons between the characteristics and 
      recovery profiles of stroke survivors in different regions. Thus, this study lays 
      out the basis to identify early predictors for upper limb recovery, inform 
      clinical decision-making in Asian stroke survivors and establish tailored therapy 
      programs. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier:

TI  - Modulation of corticospinal excitability related to the forearm muscle during 
      robot-assisted stepping in humans.
PG  - 1089-1100
LID - 10.1007/s00221-023-06565-1 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, the neural control mechanisms of the arms and legs during human 
      bipedal walking have been clarified. Rhythmic leg stepping leads to suppression 
      of monosynaptic reflex excitability in forearm muscles. However, it is unknown 
      whether and how corticospinal excitability of the forearm muscle is modulated 
      during leg stepping. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the 
      excitability of the corticospinal tract in the forearm muscle during passive and 
      voluntary stepping. To compare the neural effects on corticospinal excitability 
      to those on monosynaptic reflex excitability, the present study also assessed the 
      excitability of the H-reflex in the forearm muscle during both types of stepping. 
      A robotic gait orthosis was used to produce leg stepping movements similar to 
      those of normal walking. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and H-reflexes were 
      evoked in the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle during passive and voluntary 
      stepping. The results showed that FCR MEP amplitudes were significantly enhanced 
      during the mid-stance and terminal-swing phases of voluntary stepping, while 
      there was no significant difference between the phases during passive stepping. 
      Conversely, the FCR H-reflex was suppressed during both voluntary and passive 
      stepping, compared to the standing condition. The present results demonstrated 
      that voluntary commands to leg muscles, combined with somatosensory inputs, may 
      facilitate corticospinal excitability in the forearm muscle, and that 
      somatosensory inputs during walking play a major role in monosynaptic reflex 
      suppression in forearm muscle.

TI  - Functional Resistance Training to Improve Knee Strength and Function After Acute 
      Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Case Study.
PG  - 136-144
LID - 10.1177/1941738120955184 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thigh muscle weakness after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction 
      (ACLR) can persist after returning to activity. While resistance training can 
      improve muscle function, "nonfunctional" training methods are not optimal for 
      inducing transfer of benefits to activities such as walking. Here, we tested the 
      feasibility of a novel functional resistance training (FRT) approach to restore 
      strength and function in an individual with ACLR. HYPOTHESIS: FRT would improve 
      knee strength and function after ACLR. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: Level 5. METHODS: A 15-year-old male patient volunteered for an 8-week 
      intervention where he performed 30 minutes of treadmill walking, 3 times per 
      week, while wearing a custom-designed knee brace that provided resistance to the 
      thigh muscles of his ACLR leg. Thigh strength, gait mechanics, and corticospinal 
      and spinal excitability were assessed before and immediately after the 8-week 
      intervention. Voluntary muscle activation was evaluated immediately after the 
      intervention. RESULTS: Knee extensor and flexor strength increased in the ACLR 
      leg from pre- to posttraining (130 to 225 N·m [+74%] and 44 to 88 N·m [+99%], 
      respectively) and increases in between-limb extensor and flexor strength symmetry 
      (45% to 92% [+74%] and 47% to 72% [+65%], respectively) were also noted. After 
      the intervention, voluntary muscle activation in the ACLR leg was 72%, compared 
      with the non-ACLR leg at 75%. Knee angle and moment during late stance phase 
      decreased (ie, improved) in the ACLR leg and appeared more similar to the 
      non-ACLR leg after FRT training (18° to 14° [-23.4] and 0.07 to -0.02 
      N·m·kg(-1)·m(-1) [-122.8%], respectively). Corticospinal and spinal excitability 
      in the ACLR leg decreased (3511 to 2511 [-28.5%] and 0.42 to 0.24 [-43.7%], 
      respectively) from pre- to posttraining. CONCLUSION: A full 8 weeks of FRT that 
      targeted both quadriceps and hamstring muscles lead to improvements in strength 
      and gait, suggesting that FRT may constitute a promising and practical 
      alternative to traditional methods of resistance training. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 
      FRT may serve as a viable approach to improve knee strength and function after 
      ACL reconstruction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect and mechanism of robot-assisted upper limb 
      training (RT) combined with intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) for 
      stroke patients are unclear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate 
      changes in brain activation after combination therapy and RT alone using 
      functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). METHODS: Patients were randomly 
      assigned to two groups (iTBS + RT Group, n = 18, and RT Group, n = 18). Training 
      was conducted five times a week for four weeks. fNIRS was used to measure changes 
      in oxyhemoglobin in both the primary motor cortex (M1) and pre-motor and 
      supplementary motor area (pSMA) during affected limb movement. Fugl-Meyer 
      Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) was employed for evaluating the function of 
      upper limbs. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with subacute stroke completed the 
      study. The cortex of both hemispheres was extensively activated prior to 
      treatment in the RT group. After training, overactivation decreased. The brain 
      activation of the combined treatment group transferred to the affected side after 
      the treatment. There was a notable enhancement in the FMA-UE scores for both 
      groups, with the combined group's progress significantly surpassing that of the 
      RT group. CONCLUSION: RT combined with iTBS can improve the motor function of 
      stroke patients and promote the balance between cerebral hemispheres.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the 
      central nervous system, affecting ambulation even in people with only mild 
      neurological signs. Patients with MS frequently experience spasticity, which 
      contributes significantly to impair their motor functions, including ambulation, 
      owing to muscle stiffness, spasms, and pain. OBJECTIVES: To clarify the role of 
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol(THC):cannabidiol(CBD) oromucosal spray, coupled to 
      robot-aided gait training (RAGT) using the Lokomat©Pro to improve functional 
      ambulation in patients with MS. METHODS: We compared 20 patients with MS, who 
      were treated with THC:CBD oromucosal spray in add-on to the ongoing oral 
      antispastic therapy (OAT) (group A), with 20 individuals with MS (matched for 
      clinical-demographic characteristics) who were treated only with OAT (group B). 
      Both the groups underwent RAGT using the Lokomat-Pro (three 45-minute sessions 
      per week). Our primary outcome measures were the Functional Independence Measure 
      (FIM) and the 10 meters walking test (10MWT). As secondary outcome measures we 
      evaluated the brain cortical excitability by using Transcranial Magnetic 
      Stimulation. Both parameters were taken before and after the end of the RAGT. 
      RESULTS: FIM improved in group A more than in group B (p<0.001). Moreover, 10MWT 
      decreased in group A more than in group B (p<0.001). These clinical findings were 
      paralleled by a more evident reshape of intracortical excitability in both upper 
      and lower limbs, as suggested by motor evoked potential amplitude increase 
      (p<0.001), intracortical inhibition strengthening (p<0.001), and intracortical 
      facilitation decrease (p=0.01) in group A as compared to group B. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our results suggest that the combined THC:CBD-RAGT approach could be useful in 
      improving gait performance in patients with MS.

AB  - The Stroop task is a well-established tool to investigate the influence of 
      competing visual categories on decision making. Neuroimaging as well as rTMS 
      studies have demonstrated the involvement of parietal structures, particularly 
      the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), in this task. Given its reliability, the 
      numerical Stroop task was used to compare the effects of different TMS targeting 
      approaches by Sack and colleagues (Sack AT 2009), who elegantly demonstrated the 
      superiority of individualized fMRI targeting. We performed the present study to 
      test whether fMRI-guided rTMS effects on numerical Stroop task performance could 
      still be observed while using more advanced techniques that have emerged in the 
      last decade (e.g., electrical sham, robotic coil holder system, etc.). To do so 
      we used a traditional reaction time analysis and we performed, post-hoc, a more 
      advanced comprehensive drift diffusion modeling approach. Fifteen participants 
      performed the numerical Stroop task while active or sham 10 Hz rTMS was applied 
      over the region of the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) showing the strongest 
      functional activation in the Incongruent > Congruent contrast. This target was 
      determined based on individualized fMRI data collected during a separate session. 
      Contrary to our assumption, the classical reaction time analysis did not show any 
      superiority of active rTMS over sham, probably due to confounds such as potential 
      cumulative rTMS effects, and the effect of practice. However, the modeling 
      approach revealed a robust effect of rTMS on the drift rate variable, suggesting 
      differential processing of congruent and incongruent properties in perceptual 
      decision-making, and more generally, illustrating that more advanced 
      computational analysis of performance can elucidate the effects of rTMS on the 
      brain where simpler methods may not.

TI  - Double Fascicular Nerve Transfer Restored Nearly Normal Functional Movements in a

      Report and Review of Recent Literature.
PG  - e938650

AB  - BACKGROUND Cervical spine deformities can occur because of genetic, congenital, 
      inflammatory, degenerative, or iatrogenic causes. CASE REPORT We report a 
      45-year-old woman who presented to our clinic with complete paralysis of the left 
      upper extremity 5 months after C4-C6 discectomy and fusion surgery. The 
      electrodiagnostic and EMG reports 3 months after her previous surgery revealed 
      left C5-C7 polyradiculopathy involving the upper trunk, lateral and posterior 
      cords, and atrophy of the left deltoids, triceps, and biceps muscles. She 
      underwent the following nerve transfer procedures with the senior author (RKN): 
      The median nerve fascicles were transferred to the biceps and brachialis branches 
      of the musculocutaneous nerve. Radial nerve triceps branches were transferred to 
      the deltoid and teres minor branches of the axillary nerve. The patient could 
      fully abduct her left shoulder to 170°, and the LUE functions were restored to 
      nearly normal 17 months after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS Neurolysis combined with 
      nerve transfer might be the most effective treatment for cervical spinal root 
      injuries. Advances in peripheral nerve rewiring, transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation, brain-computer interface robotic technologies, and emerging 
      rehabilitation will undoubtedly increase the possibility of reviving the 
      extremities in patients with central pathology by restoring the descending motor 
      signals through the residual neural network connections.

TI  - Stabilization of body balance with Light Touch following a mechanical 
      perturbation: Adaption of sway and disruption of right posterior parietal cortex 
      by cTBS.

AB  - Light touch with an earth-fixed reference point improves balance during quite 
      standing. In our current study, we implemented a paradigm to assess the effects 
      of disrupting the right posterior parietal cortex on dynamic stabilization of 
      body sway with and without Light Touch after a graded, unpredictable mechanical 
      perturbation. We hypothesized that the benefit of Light Touch would be amplified 
      in the more dynamic context of an external perturbation, reducing body sway and 
      muscle activations before, at and after a perturbation. Furthermore, we expected 
      sway stabilization would be impaired following disruption of the right Posterior 
      Parietal Cortex as a result of increased postural stiffness. Thirteen young 
      adults stood blindfolded in Tandem-Romberg stance on a force plate and were 
      required either to keep light fingertip contact to an earth-fixed reference point 
      or to stand without fingertip contact. During every trial, a robotic arm pushed a 
      participant's right shoulder in medio-lateral direction. The testing consisted of 
      4 blocks before TMS stimulation and 8 blocks after, which alternated between 
      Light Touch and No Touch conditions. In summary, we found a strong effect of 
      Light Touch, which resulted in improved stability following a perturbation. Light 
      Touch decreased the immediate sway response, steady state sway following 
      re-stabilization, as well as muscle activity of the Tibialis Anterior. 
      Furthermore, we saw gradual decrease of muscle activity over time, which 
      indicates an adaptive process following exposure to repetitive trials of 
      perturbations. We were not able to confirm our hypothesis that disruption of the 
      rPPC leads to increased postural stiffness. However, after disruption of the 
      rPPC, muscle activity of the Tibialis Anterior is decreased more compared to 
      sham. We conclude that rPPC disruption enhanced the intra-session adaptation to 
      the disturbing effects of the perturbation.

AB  - Background: In this study, a novel electromechanical robotic exoskeleton was 
      developed for the rehabilitation of distal joints. The objective was to explore 
      the functional MRI and the neurophysiological changes in cortical-excitability in 
      response to exoskeleton training for a 9-year chronic stroke patient. 
      Case-Report: The study involved a 52-year old female patient with a 9-year 
      chronic stroke of the right hemisphere, who underwent 20 therapy sessions of 45 
      min each. Cortical-excitability and clinical-scales: Fugl-Mayer (FM), Modified 
      Ashworth Scale (MAS), Brunnstrom-Stage (BS), Barthel-Index (BI), Range of Motion 
      (ROM), were assessed pre-and post-therapy to quantitatively assess the motor 
      recovery. Clinical Rehabilitation Impact: Increase in FM wrist/hand by 6, BI by 
      10, and decrease in MAS by 1 were reported. Ipsilesional Motor Evoked Potential 
      (MEP) (obtained using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) was increased by 98 μV 
      with a decrease in RMT by 6% and contralesional MEP was increased by 43 μV with a 
      decrease in RMT by 4%. Laterality Index of Sensorimotor Cortex (SMC) reduced in 
      precentral- gyrus (from 0.152 to -0.707) and in postcentral-gyrus (from 0.203 to 
      -0.632). Conclusion: The novel exoskeleton-based training showed improved motor 
      outcomes, cortical excitability, and neuronal activation. The research encourages 
      the further investigation of the potential of exoskeleton training.
